6A80.2  Current depressive episode persistent  


In the context of a current mood episode (manic, depressive, mixed, or hypomanic), 
there have been recurrent panic attacks (i.e., at least two) during the past month 
that occur specifically in response to  anxiety -provoking cognitions that are features 
of the mood episode. If panic attacks occur exclusively in response to such 
thoughts, panic attacks should be recorded using this qualifier rather than assigning 
an additional co -occurring diagnosis of panic disorder.  
If some panic attacks over the course of the depressive or mixed episode have 
been unexpected and not exclusively in response to depressive or anxiety -
provoking thoughts, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be assigned.  
Coding Note:  These categories should never be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify specific 
clinically important features of mood episodes in mood disorders.  
Exclusions:  Panic disorder ( 6B01)
