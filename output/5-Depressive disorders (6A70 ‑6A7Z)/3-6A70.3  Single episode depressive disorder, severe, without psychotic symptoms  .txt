6A70.3  Single episode depressive disorder, severe, without psychotic symptoms  


Single episode depressive disorder, moderate, with psychotic symptoms is 
diagnosed when the definitional requirements of a depressive episode have been 
met, there is no history of prior depressive episodes, the episode is of moderate 
severity, and there are delusions or hallucinations during the episode. A depressive 
episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in 
activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least 
two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, 
feelings of worthlessnes s or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, 
recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor 
agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a moderate depressive 
episode, several symptoms of a depressi ve episode are present to a marked 
degree, or a large number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present 
overall. The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple 
domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupat ional, or other important 
domains).
