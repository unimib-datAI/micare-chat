6A80.5  Rapid cycling  


In the context of recurrent depressive disorder, bipolar type I or bipolar type II 
disorder, there has been a regular seasonal pattern of onset and remission of at 
least one type of episode (i.e., depressive, manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes), 
with a su bstantial majority of the relevant mood episodes corresponding to the 
seasonal pattern. (In bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorder, all types of mood 
episodes may not follow this pattern.) A seasonal pattern should be differentiated 
from an episode th at is coincidental with a particular season but predominantly 
related to a psychological stressor that regularly occurs at that time of the year (e.g., 
seasonal unemployment).  
Coding Note:  These categories should never be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify specific 
clinically important features of mood episodes in mood disorders.
