pleasure in most activities that are normally enjoyable to the individual (i.e., 
pervasive anhedonia); lack of emotiona l reactivity to normally pleasurable stimuli or 
circumstances (i.e., mood does not lift even transiently with exposure); terminal

depressive symptoms are worse in the morning; marked psychomotor retardation or 
agitation; marked loss of appetite or loss of weight.
