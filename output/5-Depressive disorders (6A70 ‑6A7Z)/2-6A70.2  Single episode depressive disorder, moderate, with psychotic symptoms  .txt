6A70.2  Single episode depressive disorder, moderate, with psychotic symptoms  


Single episo de depressive disorder, moderate, without psychotic symptoms is 
diagnosed when the definitional requirements of a depressive episode have been 
met, there is no history of prior depressive episodes, the episode is of moderate 
severity, and there are no delu sions or hallucinations during the episode. A 
depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished 
interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period 
lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other  symptoms such as difficulty 
concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, 
hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, 
psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatig ue. In a moderate 
depressive episode, several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a 
marked degree, or a large number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are 
present overall. The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning  in 
multiple domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other 
important domains).
