6B24.0  Hoarding disorder with fair to good insight  


All definitional requirements of hypochondriasis are met. Most or all of the  time, the 
individual is convinced that the disorder -specific beliefs are true and cannot accept 
an alternative explanation for their experience. The lack of insight exhibited by the 
individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.

   6B24   Hoarding disorder  
Hoarding disorder is characterised by accumulation of possessions that results in 
living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is 
compromised. Accumulation occurs due to both repetitive urges or behaviours 
related to amassing item s and difficulty discarding possessions due to a perceived 
need to save items and distress associated with discarding them. If living areas are 
uncluttered this is only due to the intervention of third parties (e.g., family members, 
cleaners, authorities).  Amassment may be passive (e.g. accumulation of incoming 
flyers or mail) or active (e.g. excessive acquisition of free, purchased, or stolen 
items). The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educatio nal, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning.
