6B20.1  Obsessive -compulsive disorder with poor to absent insight  


All definitional requirements of obsessive -compulsive disorder are met. Much o f the 
time, the individual is able to entertain the possibility that his or her disorder -specific 
beliefs may not be true and is willing to accept an alternative explanation for his or 
her experience. At circumscribed times (e.g., when highly anxious), the  individual 
may demonstrate no insight.
