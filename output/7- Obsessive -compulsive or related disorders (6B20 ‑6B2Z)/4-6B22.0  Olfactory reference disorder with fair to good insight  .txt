  6B22   Olfactory reference disorder  
Olfactory Reference Disorder is characterised by persistent preoccupation with the 
belief that one is emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour or breath that is 
either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. Individuals experience 
exce ssive self -consciousness about the perceived odour, often with ideas of 
reference (i.e., the conviction that people are taking notice, judging, or talking about 
the odour). In response to their preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and 
excessive behaviours such as repeatedly checking for body odour or checking the 
perceived source of the smell, or repeatedly seeking reassurance, excessive 
attempts to camouflage, alter, or prevent the perceived odour, or marked avoidance 
of social situations or tri ggers that increase distress about the perceived foul or 
offensive odour. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant 
distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of fu nctioning.
