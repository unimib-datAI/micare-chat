6B25.0  Trichotillomania  


All definitional requirements of hoarding disorder are met. Most or all of the time, the 
individual is convinced that that hoarding -related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining 
to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or cl utter) are not problematic, despite 
evidence to the contrary. The lack of insight exhibited by the individual does not 
vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.

  6B25   Body -focused repetitive behaviour disorder s 
Body focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterised by recurrent and 
habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair -pulling, skin -picking, lip -biting), 
typically accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour 
involved, and which lead to dermatological sequelae (e.g., hair loss, skin lesions, lip 
abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day 
or in less frequent but more sustained periods. The symptoms result in significant 
distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning.
