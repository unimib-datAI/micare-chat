6B23.1  Hypochondriasis with poor to absent insight  


All definitional requirements of hypochondriasis are met. Much of the time, the 
individual is able to entertain the possibility that his or her disorder -specific beliefs 
may not be true and is willing to accept an alternative explan ation for his or her 
experience. At circumscribed times (e.g., when highly anxious), the individual may 
demonstrate no insight.
