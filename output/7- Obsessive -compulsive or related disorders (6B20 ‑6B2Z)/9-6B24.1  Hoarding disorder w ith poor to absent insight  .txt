6B24.1  Hoarding disorder w ith poor to absent insight  


All definitional requirements of hoarding disorder are met. The individual recognizes 
that hoarding -related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to  excessive acquisition, 
difficulty discarding, or clutter) are problematic. This qualifier level may still be 
applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g., when being forced to discard items), the 
individual demonstrates no insight.
