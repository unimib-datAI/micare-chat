6B21.0  Body dysmorphic disorder with fair to good insight  


All definitional requirements of obsessive -compulsive disorder are met. Most or all 
of the time, the individual is convinced that the disorder -specifi c beliefs are true and 
cannot accept an alternative explanation for their experience. The lack of insight 
exhibited by the individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.

   6B21   Body d ysmorphic disorder  
Body Dysmorphic Disorder is characterised by persistent preoccupation with one or 
more perceived defects or flaws in appearance that are either unnoticeable or only 
slightly noticeable to others. Individuals experience excessive self -consciousness, 
often with ideas of reference (i.e., the conviction that people are taking notice, 
judging, or talking about the perceived defect or flaw). In response to their 
preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and excessive behaviours that 
include repeated examination of the appearance or severity of the perceived defect 
or flaw, excessive attempts to camouflage or alter the perceived defect, or marked 
avoidance of social situations or triggers that increase distress about the perceived 
defect or  flaw. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other important areas of functioning.
