  
Mood Disorders refers to a superordinate grouping of Bipolar and Depressive  Disorders. Mood 
disorders are defined according to particular types of mood episodes and their pattern over time. The 
primary types of mood episodes are Depressive episode, Manic episode, Mixed episode, and 
Hypomanic episode. Mood episodes are not indepen dently diagnosable entities, and therefore do not 
have their own diagnostic codes. Rather, mood episodes make up the primary components of most of 
the Depressive and Bipolar Disorders.
