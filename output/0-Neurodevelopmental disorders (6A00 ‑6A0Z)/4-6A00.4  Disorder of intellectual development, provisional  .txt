6A00.4  Disorder of intellectual development, provisional  


A profound disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the 
developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual 
functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approx imately four or more standard 
deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 0.003rd percentile), based 
on individually administered appropriately normed, standardized tests or by 
comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unava ilable. 
Affected persons possess very limited communication abilities and capacity for 
acquisition of academic skills is restricted to basic concrete skills. They may also 
have co -occurring motor and sensory impairments and typically require daily 
support in a supervised environment for adequate care. Severe and profound 
disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of 
adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence 
cannot reliably or va lidly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning 
below the 0.003rd percentile.
