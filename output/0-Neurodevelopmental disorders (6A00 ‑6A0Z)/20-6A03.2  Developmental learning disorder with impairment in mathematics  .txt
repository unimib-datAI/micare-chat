6A03.2  Developmental learning disorder with impairment in mathematics  


Developmental learning disorder with impairment in written expression is 
characterised by significant and persi stent difficulties in learning academic skills 
related to writing, such as spelling accuracy, grammar and punctuation accuracy, 
and organisation and coherence of ideas in writing. The individual’s performance in 
written expression is markedly below what wo uld be expected for chronological age 
and level of intellectual functioning and results in significant impairment in the 
individual’s academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder 
with impairment in written expression is not due to a disorder of intellectual 
development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), a neurological or motor 
disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of 
academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity.
