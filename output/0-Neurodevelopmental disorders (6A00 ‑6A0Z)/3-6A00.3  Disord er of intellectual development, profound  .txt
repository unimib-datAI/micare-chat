6A00.3  Disord er of intellectual development, profound  


A severe disorder of intellectual development is a c ondition originating during the 
developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual 
functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately four or more standard 
deviations below the mean (less than approximately the 0.003rd pe rcentile), based 
on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by 
comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. 
Affected persons exhibit very limited language and capacity for acquisition of 
academic  skills. They may also have motor impairments and typically require daily 
support in a supervised environment for adequate care, but may acquire basic self -
care skills with intensive training. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual 
development are d ifferentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour 
differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or 
validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd 
percentile.
