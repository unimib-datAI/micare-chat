6A00.1  Disorder of intellectual development, moderate  


A mild disorder of intellectual development is a co ndition originating during the 
developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual 
functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately two to three standard 
deviations below the mean (approximately 0.1 â€“ 2.3 percentile), ba sed on 
appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by 
comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. 
Affected persons often exhibit difficulties in the acquisition and comprehension of 
complex language  concepts and academic skills. Most master basic self -care, 
domestic, and practical activities. Persons affected by a mild disorder of intellectual 
development can generally achieve relatively independent living and employment 
as adults but may require app ropriate support.
