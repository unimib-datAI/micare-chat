  6A03   Developmental learning disorder  
Developmental learning disorder is characterised by significant and persistent 
difficulties in learning academic skills, which may include reading, writing, or 
arithmetic. The individual’s performance in the affected academic skill(s) is 
markedly below wha t would be expected for chronological age and general level of 
intellectual functioning, and results in significant impairment in the individual’s 
academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder first 
manifests when academic skills ar e taught during the early school years. 
Developmental learning disorder is not due to a disorder of intellectual 
development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), neurological or motor 
disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of 
academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity.
