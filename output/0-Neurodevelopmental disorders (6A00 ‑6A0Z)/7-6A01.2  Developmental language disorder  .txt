6A01.2  Developmental language disorder  


Developmental speech fluency disorder is characterised by frequent or pervasive 
disruption of the normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech characterised by 
repetitions and prolongations in sounds, syllables, words, and phrases, as well as 
blocking and word avoidance or substitutions. The speech dysfluency is persistent 
over time. The onset of speech dysfluency occurs during the developmental period 
and speech fluency is markedly below what would be expected for age. Spee ch 
dysfluency results in significant impairment in social communication, personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The 
speech dysfluency is not better accounted for by a Disorder of Intellectual 
Developmen t, a Disease of the Nervous System, a sensory impairment, or a 
structural abnormality, or other speech or voice disorder.
