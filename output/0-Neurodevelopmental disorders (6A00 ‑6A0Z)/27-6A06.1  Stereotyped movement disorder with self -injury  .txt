6A06.1  Stereotyped movement disorder with self -injury  


This category should be applied to forms of Stereotyped movement disorder in 
which stereotyped behaviours markedly interfere with normal activities, but do not 
result in self -inflicted bodily injury. Stereotyped movement disorder without self -
injury is ch aracterised by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless 
(and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period, 
are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication 
(including withdrawal ), and markedly interfere with normal activities. Stereotyped 
movements that are non -injurious can include body rocking, head rocking, finger -
flicking mannerisms, and hand flapping.
