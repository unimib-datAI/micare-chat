6A02.0  Autism spectrum disorder without disorder of intellectual development and 


Developmental language disorder with other specified language impairment is 
characterised by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, production 
or use of language (spoken or signed), that arise during the developmental period 
and cause s ignificant limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate. The 
pattern of specific deficits in language abilities is not adequately captured by any of 
the other developmental language disorder categories.

  6A02   Autism spectrum disorder  
Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to 
initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, an d by 
a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or 
activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and 
sociocultural context. The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental 
perio d, typically in early childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest 
until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are sufficiently 
severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other imp ortant areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the 
individual’s functioning observable in all settings, although they may vary according 
to social, educational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a full 
range of in tellectual functioning and language abilities.
