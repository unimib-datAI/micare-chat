6A00.0  Disorder of intellectual development, mild  

  
Neurodevelopmental disorders are behavioural and cognitive disorders that arise during the 
developmental period t hat involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific 
intellectual, motor, language, or social functions. Although behavioural and cognitive deficits are 
present in many mental and behavioural disorders that can arise during the  developmental period 
(e.g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder), only disorders whose core features are neurodevelopmental 
are included in this grouping. The presumptive etiology for neurodevelopmental disorders is complex, 
and in many individual cases is un known.

  6A00   Disorders of intellectual development  
Disorders of intellectual development are a group of etiologically diverse conditions 
originating dur ing the developmental period characterised by significantly below 
average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately two 
or more standard deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 2.3rd 
percentile), based on appropr iately normed, individually administered standardized 
tests. Where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, 
diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgment based on appropriate assessm ent of comparable behavioural 
indicators.  
Coding Note:  Use additional code, if desired, to identify any known aetiology.
