All definitional requirements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are met. Both 
inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive symptoms are clinically significant, with 
neither predominating in the clinical presentation. Inattention refers to significant 
difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of 
stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. 
Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, 
most evi dent in structured situations that require behavioural self -control. Impulsivity 
is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or 
consideration of the risks and consequences.

  6A06   Stereotyped movement disorder  
Stereotyped movement disorder is characterised by the persistent (e.g., lasting 
several months) presence of volun tary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently 
purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early 
developmental period, are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a 
substance or medication (including withdrawal), and markedly inte rfere with normal 
activities or result in self -inflicted bodily injury. Stereotyped movements that are 
non-injurious can include body rocking, head rocking, finger -flicking mannerisms, 
and hand flapping. Stereotyped self -injurious behaviours can include re petitive head 
banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of the hands, lips, or other body 
parts.
