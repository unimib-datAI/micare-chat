6A01.1  Developmental speech fluency disorder  


Developmental speech sound disorder is characterised by difficulties in the 
acquisition, production and perception of speech that result in errors of 
pronunciation, either in number or types of speec h errors made or the overall quality 
of speech production, that are outside the limits of normal variation expected for age 
and level of intellectual functioning and result in reduced intelligibility and 
significantly affect communication. The errors in pr onunciation arise during the early 
developmental period and cannot be explained by social, cultural, and other 
environmental variations (e.g., regional dialects). The speech errors are not fully 
explained by a hearing impairment or a structural or neurolog ical abnormality.
