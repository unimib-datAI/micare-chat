6A00.2  Disorder of intellectual development, severe  


A moderate disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the 
developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual 
functioning and ad aptive behaviour that are approximately three to four standard 
deviations below the mean (approximately 0.003 â€“ 0.1 percentile), based on 
appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by 
comparable behavioural indicators when standa rdized testing is unavailable. 
Language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills of persons affected by a 
moderate disorder of intellectual development vary but are generally limited to basic 
skills. Some may master basic self -care, domestic, and pr actical activities. Most 
affected persons require considerable and consistent support in order to achieve 
independent living and employment as adults.
