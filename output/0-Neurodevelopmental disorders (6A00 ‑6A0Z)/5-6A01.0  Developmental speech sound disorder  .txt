Coding Note:  Use additional code, if desired, to identify any known aetiology.  
 
  6A01   Developmental speech or language disorders  
Developmental speech or language disorders arise during the developmental period 
and are characterised by difficulties in understanding o r producing speech and 
language or in using language in context for the purposes of communication that 
are outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual 
functioning. The observed speech and language problems are not attr ibutable to 
regional, social, or cultural/ethnic language variations and are not fully explained by 
anatomical or neurological abnormalities. The presumptive aetiology for 
Developmental speech or language disorders is complex, and in many individual 
cases,  is unknown.
