6A01.23  Developmental language disorder, with other specified language impairment  


Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language is 
characterised b y persistent and marked difficulties with the understanding and use 
of language in social contexts, for example making inferences, understanding verbal 
humour, and resolving ambiguous meaning. These difficulties arise during the 
developmental period, typic ally during early childhood, and cause significant 
limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate. Pragmatic language abilities 
are markedly below the expected level given the individual’s age and level of 
intellectual functioning, but the other co mponents of receptive and expressive 
language are relatively intact. This qualifier should not be used if the pragmatic 
language impairment is better explained by Autism Spectrum Disorder or by 
impairments in other components of receptive or expressive lan guage.
