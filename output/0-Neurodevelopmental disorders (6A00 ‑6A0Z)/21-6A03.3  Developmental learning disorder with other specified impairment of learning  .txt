6A03.3  Developmental learning disorder with other specified impairment of learning  


Developmental learning disorder with impairment in mathematics is characterised 
by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic ski lls related to 
mathematics or arithmetic, such as number sense, memorization of number facts, 
accurate calculation, fluent calculation, and accurate mathematic reasoning. The 
individual’s performance in mathematics or arithmetic is markedly below what woul d 
be expected for chronological or developmental age and level of intellectual 
functioning and results in significant impairment in the individual’s academic or 
occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder with impairment in 
mathematics is not  due to a disorder of intellectual development, sensory 
impairment (vision or hearing), a neurological disorder, lack of availability of 
education, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or 
psychosocial adversity.
