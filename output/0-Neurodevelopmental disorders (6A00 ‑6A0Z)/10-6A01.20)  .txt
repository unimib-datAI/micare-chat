Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly expressive language is 
characterised by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, production, and use of 
language that arise during the developmental period, typically during early 
childhood, and cause significant limitations in the individual’s ability to 
communicate. The ability to produce and use spoken or signed languag e (i.e., 
expressive language) is markedly below the expected level given the individual’s 
age and level of intellectual functioning, but the ability to understand spoken or 
signed language (i.e., receptive language) is relatively intact.
