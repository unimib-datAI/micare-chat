language  
Developmental language disorder with impairment of receptive and expressive 
language is characterised by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, 
production, and use of language that arise duri ng the developmental period, 
typically during early childhood, and cause significant limitations in the individual’s 
ability to communicate. The ability to understand spoken or signed language (i.e., 
receptive language) is markedly below the expected level  given the individual’s age 
and level of intellectual functioning, and is accompanied by persistent impairment in 
the ability to produce and use spoken or signed language (i.e., expressive 
language).
