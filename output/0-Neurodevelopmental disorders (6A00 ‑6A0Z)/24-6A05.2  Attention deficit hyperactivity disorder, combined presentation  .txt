presentation  
All definition al requirements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are met and 
hyperactive -impulsive symptoms are predominant in the clinical presentation. 
Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, 
most evident in st ructured situations that require behavioural self -control. Impulsivity 
is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or 
consideration of the risks and consequences. Some inattentive symptoms may also 
be present, but these are not clinically significant in relation to the hyperactive -
impulsive symptoms.
