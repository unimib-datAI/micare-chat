6A01.20  Developmental language disorder with imp airment of receptive and expressive 


Developmental language disorder is characterised by persisten t deficits in the 
acquisition, understanding, production or use of language (spoken or signed), that 
arise during the developmental period, typically during early childhood, and cause 
significant limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate. The individual’s 
ability to understand, produce or use language is markedly below what would be 
expected given the individual’s age. The language deficits are not explained by 
another neurodevelopmental disorder or a sensory impairment or neurological 
conditio n, including the effects of brain injury or infection.
