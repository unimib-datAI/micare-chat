  
Impulse control disorders are characterised by the repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge 
to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short -term, despite consequences 
such as longer -term harm either to the individual o r to others, marked distress about the behaviour 
pattern, or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other 
important areas of functioning. Impulse Control Disorders involve a range of specific behaviours, 
including  fire-setting, stealing, sexual behaviour, and explosive outbursts.

  6C70   Pyromania  
Pyromania is characterised by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to set 
fires, resulting in multiple acts of, or attempts at, settin g fire to property or other 
objects, in the absence of an apparent motive (e.g., monetary gain, revenge, 
sabotage, political statement, attracting attention or recognition). There is an 
increasing sense of tension or affective arousal prior to instances of  fire setting, 
persistent fascination or preoccupation with fire and related stimuli (e.g., watching 
fires, building fires, fascination with firefighting equipment), and a sense of pleasure, 
excitement, relief or gratification during, and immediately after  the act of setting the 
fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath. The behaviour is not 
better explained by intellectual impairment, another mental and behavioural 
disorder, or substance intoxication.

Fire-setting as the reason for observation for suspected mental 
or behavioural disorders, ruled out (QA02.3)  
 
  6C71   Kleptomania  
Kleptomania is characterised by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to 
steal objects in the absence of an apparent motive (e.g., objects are not acquired 
for personal use or monetary gain). There is an increasing sense of ten sion or 
affective arousal before instances of theft and a sense of pleasure, excitement, 
relief, or gratification during and immediately after the act of stealing. The behaviour 
is not better explained by intellectual impairment, another mental and behavio ural 
disorder, or substance intoxication.  
Coding Note:  If stealing occurs within the context of conduct -dissocial disorder or a manic 
episode, Kleptomania should not be diagnosed separately.  
Inclusions:  pathological stealing  
Exclusions:  shoplifting as the reason for observation for suspected mental 
disorder, ruled out (QA02.3)

   6C72   Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder  
Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern of 
failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive 
sexual behaviour. Symptoms may include repetitive sexual activities becoming a 
central focus of the person’s life to the point of neglecting health and personal care 
or other interests, activities and responsibilities; nume rous unsuccessful efforts to 
significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; and continued repetitive sexual 
behaviour despite adverse consequences or deriving little or no satisfaction from it. 
The pattern of failure to control intense, sexual impulses or urges and resulting 
repetitive sexual behaviour is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 6 
months or more), and causes marked distress or significant impairment in personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas  of functioning. 
Distress that is entirely related to moral judgments and disapproval about sexual 
impulses, urges, or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement.  
Exclusions:  Paraphilic disorders  (6D30‑6D3Z)  
 
  6C73   Intermittent explosive disorder  
Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by repeated brief episodes of verbal 
or physical aggression or destruction of property that represent a failure to control 
aggressive impulses, with the intensity of the outbu rst or degree of aggressiveness 
being grossly out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating psychosocial 
stressors. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural, 
or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not part of a pattern o f chronic anger and 
irritability (e.g., in oppositional defiant disorder). The behaviour pattern is of 
sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.  
Exclusions:  Oppositional defiant disorder (6C90)
