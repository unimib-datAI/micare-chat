  
Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances, characterized by the co -occurrence 
of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. The assessment of 
catatonia is complex and requires observation, interview and physical exam. Catatonia can occur in 
the context of another mental disorder, such as Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders, 
Mood Disorders, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, especially Autism Spectrum Disorder. Catatonia 
can also develop duri ng or soon after intoxication or withdrawal from certain psychoactive substances, 
including phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and 
MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of certain psychoactive and non -psychoac tive medications 
(e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Finally,
