6C51.1  Gaming disorder, predominantly offline  


Gaming disorder, predominantly online is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming 
behaviour (‘digital gaming’ or ‘video -gaming’) that is primarily conducted over the internet and is 
manifested by:  
1. impaired control over gaming (e.g., ons et, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);  
2. increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life 
interests and daily activities; and  ICD-11 MMS  557 
 3. continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of neg ative consequences. The 
behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.  
The pattern of gaming behaviour may be continuous or epi sodic and recurrent. The gaming behaviour 
and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to 
be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met 
and sympto ms are severe.
