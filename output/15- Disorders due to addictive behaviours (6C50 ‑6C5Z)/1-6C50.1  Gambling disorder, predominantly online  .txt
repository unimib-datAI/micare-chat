6C50.1  Gambling disorder, predominantly online  


Gambling disorder, predominantly offline is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent 
gambling behaviour that is not primarily conducted over the internet and is manifested by:  
1. impaired control over gambling (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, 
context);  
2. increasing priority given to gambling to the extent that gambling takes precedence over other 
life interests and daily activities; and  
3. continuation or escalation of gambling despite the occurrence of negative consequences. The 
behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.  
The pattern of gambling behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurren t. The gambling 
behaviour and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a 
diagnosis to be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic 
requirements are met and symptoms are severe.
