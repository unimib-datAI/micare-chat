  6C50   Gambling disorder  
Gambling disorder is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gambling 
behaviour, which may be online (i.e., over the internet) or offline, manifested by:  
1. impaired control over gambling (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, 
termination, context);  
2. increasing priority given to gambling to the extent that gambling takes 
precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and  
3. continuation  or escalation of gambling despite the occurrence of negative 
consequences.  
The pattern of gambling behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent. 
The pattern of gambling behaviour results in significant distress or in significant 
impairment in per sonal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning. The gambling behaviour and other features are normally 
evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned, 
although the required dura tion may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are 
met and symptoms are severe.
