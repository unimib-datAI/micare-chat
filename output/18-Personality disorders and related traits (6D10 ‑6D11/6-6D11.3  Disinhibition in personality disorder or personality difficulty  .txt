6D11.3  Disinhibition in personality disorder or personality difficulty  


The core feature of the Dissociality trait domain is disregard for the r ights and 
feelings of others, encompassing both self -centeredness and lack of empathy. 
Common manifestations of Dissociality, not all of which may be present in a given 
individual at a given time, include: self -centeredness (e.g., sense of entitlement, 
expectation of others’ admiration, positive or negative attention -seeking behaviours, 
concern with one's own needs, desires and comfort and not those of others); and 
lack of empathy (i.e., indifference to whether one’s actions inconvenience or hurt 
others, wh ich may include being deceptive, manipulative, and exploitative of others, 
being mean and physically aggressive, callousness in response to others' suffering, 
and ruthlessness in obtaining one’s goals).
