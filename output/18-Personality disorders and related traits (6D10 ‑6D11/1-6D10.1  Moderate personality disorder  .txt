6D10.1  Moderate personality disorder  


All general diagnostic requirements for Personality Disorder are met. Disturbances 
affect some areas of personality functionin g but not others (e.g., problems with self -
direction in the absence of problems with stability and coherence of identity or self -
worth), and may not be apparent in some contexts. There are problems in many 
interpersonal relationships and/or in performance of expected occupational and 
social roles, but some relationships are maintained and/or some roles carried out. 
Specific manifestations of personality disturbances are generally of mild severity. 
Mild Personality Disorder is typically not associated with s ubstantial harm to self or 
others, but may be associated with substantial distress or with impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning that is either limited to circumscribed areas (e.g., romant ic relationships; 
employment) or present in more areas but milder.
