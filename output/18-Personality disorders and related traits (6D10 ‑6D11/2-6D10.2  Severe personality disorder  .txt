6D10.2  Severe personality disorder  


All general diagnostic requirements for Personality Disorder are met. Disturbances 
affect multiple areas of personality functioning (e.g., identity or sense of self, ability 
to form intimate relationships, ability to control impulses and modulate behaviour). 
However, some areas of personality functioning may be relatively less affected. 
There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships and th e 
performance of most expected social and occupational roles is compromised to 
some degree. Relationships are likely to be characterised by conflict, avoidance, 
withdrawal, or extreme dependency (e.g., few friendships maintained, persistent 
conflict in wor k relationships and consequent occupational problems, romantic 
relationships characterised by serious disruption or inappropriate submissiveness). 
Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate 
severity. Moderate Personality D isorder is sometimes associated with harm to self 
or others, and is associated with marked impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, although 
functioning in circumscribed areas may be maintai ned.
