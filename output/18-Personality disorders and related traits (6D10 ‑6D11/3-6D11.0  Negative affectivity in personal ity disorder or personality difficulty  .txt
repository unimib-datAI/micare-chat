6D11.0  Negative affectivity in personal ity disorder or personality difficulty  


All general diagnostic requirements for Personality Disorder are met. There are 
severe disturbances in functioning of the self (e.g., sense of self may be so unstable 
that individuals report not having a sense of wh o they are or so rigid that they refuse 
to participate in any but an extremely narrow range of situations; self view may be 
characterised by self -contempt or be grandiose or highly eccentric). Problems in 
interpersonal functioning seriously affect virtuall y all relationships and the ability and 
willingness to perform expected social and occupational roles is absent or severely 
compromised. Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are severe and 
affect most, if not all, areas of personality functio ning. Severe Personality Disorder 
is often associated with harm to self or others, and is associated with severe 
impairment in all or nearly all areas of life, including personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational, and other important areas of func tioning.

  6D11   Prominent personality traits or patterns  
Trait domain qualifiers may be applied to Personality Disorders or Personality 
Difficulty to describe the characteristics of the individualâ€™s personality that are most 
prominent and that contribute to personality disturbance. Trait domains are 
continuous w ith normal personality characteristics in individuals who do not have 
Personality Disorder or Personality Difficulty. Trait domains are not diagnostic 
categories, but rather represent a set of dimensions that correspond to the 
underlying structure of perso nality. As many trait domain qualifiers may be applied 
as necessary to describe personality functioning. Individuals with more severe 
personality disturbance tend to have a greater number of prominent trait domains.
