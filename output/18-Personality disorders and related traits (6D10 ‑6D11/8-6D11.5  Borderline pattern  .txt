6D11.5  Borderline pattern  


The core feature of the Anankastia trait domain is a narrow focus on one’s rigid 
standard of perfection and of right and wrong, and on controlling one’s own and 
others’ behaviour and controlling si tuations to ensure conformity to these standards. 
Common manifestations of Anankastia, not all of which may be present in a given 
individual at a given time, include: perfectionism (e.g., concern with social rules, 
obligations, and norms of right and wrong , scrupulous attention to detail, rigid, 
systematic, day -to-day routines, hyper -scheduling and planfulness, emphasis on 
organisation, orderliness, and neatness); and emotional and behavioural constraint 
(e.g., rigid control over emotional expression, stubb ornness and inflexibility, risk -
avoidance, perseveration, and deliberativeness).
