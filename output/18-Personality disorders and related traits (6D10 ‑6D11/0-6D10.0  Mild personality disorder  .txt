  6D10   Personality  disorder  
Personality disorder is characterised by problems in functioning of aspects of the 
self (e.g., identity, self -worth, accuracy of self -view, self -direction), and/or 
interpersonal dysfunction (e.g., ability to develop and maintain close and mutuall y 
satisfying relationships, ability to understand othersâ€™ perspectives and to manage 
conflict in relationships) that have persisted over an extended period of time (e.g., 2 
years or more). The disturbance is manifest in patterns of cognition, emotional 
experience, emotional expression, and behaviour that are maladaptive (e.g., 
inflexible or poorly regulated) and is manifest across a range of personal and social 
situations (i.e., is not limited to specific relationships or social roles). The patterns of 
beha viour characterizing the disturbance are not developmentally appropriate and 
cannot be explained primarily by social or cultural factors, including socio -political 
conflict. The disturbance is associated with substantial distress or significant 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning.
