6B80.0  Anorexia Nervosa with significantly low body weight  

  
Feeding and Eating Disorders involve abnormal eating or feeding behaviours that are not explained 
by another health condition and are  not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned. Feeding 
disorders involve behavioural disturbances that are not related to body weight and shape concerns, 
such as eating of non -edible substances or voluntary regurgitation of foods. Eating disord ers involve 
abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape 
concerns.  
  6B80   Anorexia Nervosa  
Anorexia Nervosa is characterised by significantly low body weight for the 
individual’s height, age and developmental stage that is not due to another health 
condition or to the unavailability of food. A commonly used threshold is body mass 
index (BMI) les s than 18.5 kg/m² in adults and BMI -for-age under 5th percentile in 
children and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body 
weight within 6 months) may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other 
diagnostic requirements are  met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to 
gain weight as expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather 
than weight loss. Low body weight is accompanied by a persistent pattern of 
behaviours to prevent restoration of normal we ight, which may include behaviours 
aimed at reducing energy intake (restricted eating), purging behaviours (e.g. self -
induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives), and behaviours aimed at increasing energy 
expenditure (e.g. excessive exercise), typically associa ted with a fear of weight 
gain. Low body weight or shape is central to the person's self -evaluation or is 
inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive.
