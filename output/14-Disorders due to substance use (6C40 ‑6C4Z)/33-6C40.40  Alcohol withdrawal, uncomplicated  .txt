6C40.40  Alcohol withdrawal, uncomplicated  


Alcohol withdrawal is a clinically significant cluster of symptoms, behaviours and/or 
physiological features, varying in degree of severity and duration, that occurs upon 
cessation or reduction of use of alcohol in individuals who have developed Alcohol 
dependence or have used alcohol for a prolonged period or in large amounts. 
Presenting features of Alcohol withdrawal may include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g. 
tachycardia, hypertension, perspiration), increased hand tremor, nausea, retching or 
vomiting, ins omnia, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, depressed or dysphoric mood, 
transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations, and distractability. Less 
commonly, the withdrawal state is complicated by generalised tonic -clonic seizures. 
The withdra wal state may progress to a very severe form of delirium characterised 
by confusion and disorientation, delusions, and prolonged visual, tactile or auditory 
hallucinations. In such cases, a separate diagnosis of Alcohol -induced delirium 
should also be assi gned.
