6C4E.0  Episode of harmful use of other specified psychoactive substance  


Dissociative drug -induced anxiety disorder including Ketamine or PCP is 
characterise d by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological 
symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop 
during or soon after intoxication with dissociative drugs. The intensity or duration of 
the symptoms is subst antially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic 
of Dissociative drug intoxication. The amount and duration of Dissociative drug use 
must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better 
explained by a primary mental diso rder (e.g., an Anxiety and Fear -Related Disorder, 
a Depressive Disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if 
the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the dissociative drug use, if the 
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time  after cessation of the dissociative 
drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with 
anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with dissociative 
drug use).
