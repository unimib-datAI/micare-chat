6C40.4  Alcohol withdrawal  


Alcohol intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during 
or shortly after the consumption of alcohol that is characterised by disturbances in 
consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These 
disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of alcohol and their 
intensity is closely related to the amount of alcohol consumed. They are time -limited 
and abate as alcohol is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include 
impaired a ttention, inappropriate or aggressive behaviour, lability of mood and 
emotions, impaired judgment, poor coordination, unsteady gait, fine nystagmus and 
slurred speech. At more severe levels of intoxication, stupor or coma may occur. 
Alcohol intoxication ma y facilitate suicidal ideation or behaviour.
