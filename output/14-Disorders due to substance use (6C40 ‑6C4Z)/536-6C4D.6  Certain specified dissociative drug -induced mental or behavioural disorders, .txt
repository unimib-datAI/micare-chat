6C4D.6  Certain specified dissociative drug -induced mental or behavioural disorders, 


Dissociative drug -induced psychotic disorder including Ketamine or PCP is 
characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised 
thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with dissociative drugs. The intensity or duration of the symptom s is 
substantially in excess of psychotic -like disturbances of perception, cognition, or 
behaviour that are characteristic of Dissociative drug intoxication. The amount and 
duration of Dissociative drug use must be capable of producing psychotic 
symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the 
case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the dissociative drug use, if 
the symptoms persist for a  substantial period of time after cessation of the 
dissociative drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental 
disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated 
with dissociative drug use).
