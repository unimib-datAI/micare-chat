6C4D.61  Dissociative drug -induced anxiety disorder including Ketamine or PCP  


Dissociative drug -induced mood disorder including Ketamine or PCP is 
characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased 
engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that 
develop during or soon after intoxication with dissociative drugs. The intensity or 
duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are 
characteristic of Dissociative drug intoxication. The amount and duration of 
Dissociative drug use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive 
disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the 
mood symptoms preceded the onse t of the dissociative drug use, if the symptoms 
persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the dissociative drug use, 
or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with mood 
symptoms (e.g., a history of prior epis odes not associated with dissociative drug 
use).
