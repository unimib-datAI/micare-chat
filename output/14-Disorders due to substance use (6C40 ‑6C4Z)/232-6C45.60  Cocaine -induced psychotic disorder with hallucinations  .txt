6C45.60  Cocaine -induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations  


Cocaine -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. 
delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, gro ssly disorganised behaviour) 
that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cocaine. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are  characteristic of 
Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine 
use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not 
better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder 
with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms 
preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other 
evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a 
history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use).
