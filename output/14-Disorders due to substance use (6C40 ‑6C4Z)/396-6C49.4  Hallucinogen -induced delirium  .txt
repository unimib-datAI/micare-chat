6C49.4  Hallucinogen -induced delirium  


Hallucinogen intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops 
during or shortly after the consumption  of hallucinogens that is characterised by 
disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or 
coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects 
of hallucinogens and their intensity is closely related to the amount of hallucinogen 
consumed. They are time -limited and abate as the hallucinogen is cleared from the 
body. Presenting features may include hallucinations, illusions, perceptual changes 
such as depersonalisation, derealization, or synesthesias (b lending of senses, such 
as a visual stimulus evoking a smell), anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood, ideas 
of reference, paranoid ideation, impaired judgment, palpitations, sweating, blurred 
vision, tremors and incoordination. Physical signs may include ta chycardia, elevated 
blood pressure, and pupillary dilatation. In rare instances, hallucinogen intoxication 
may facilitate suicidal ideation and behaviour.
