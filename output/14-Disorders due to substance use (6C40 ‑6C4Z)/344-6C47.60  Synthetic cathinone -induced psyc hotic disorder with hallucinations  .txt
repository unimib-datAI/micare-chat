6C47.60  Synthetic cathinone -induced psyc hotic disorder with hallucinations  


Synthetic cathinone -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic 
symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly 
disorganised behaviour) that develop d uring or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from synthetic cathinones. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is 
substantially in excess of psychotic -like disturbances of perception, cognition, or 
behaviour that are characteristic of Synthetic c athinone intoxication or Synthetic 
cathinone withdrawal. The amount and duration of synthetic cathinone use must be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood dis order with psychotic 
symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of 
the synthetic cathinone use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time 
after cessation of the synthetic cathinone use or withdrawal, or if t here is other 
evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a 
history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic cathinone use).
