6C4E.7  Certain other specified psychoactive substance -induced mental or 


Psychotic disorder i nduced by other specified psychoactive substance is 
characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised 
thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or withdrawal from a specif ied psychoactive substance. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of 
intoxication with or withdrawal from a specified psychoactive substance. The 
amount and duration of use of the specified psychoactive substance must be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic 
sympt oms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of 
the use of the specified psychoactive substance, if the symptoms persist for a 
substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the specified psychoactive 
substance or withd rawal from the specified psychoactive substance, or if there is 
other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms 
(e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of the specified 
psychoactive substance).
