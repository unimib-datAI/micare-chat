consumed. They are time -limited and abate as cannabis is cleared from the body. 
Presenting features may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, 
impaired judgment, perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered 
perception of time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, 
intensification of ordinary experiences, impaired short -term memory, and 
sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes) 
and tachycardia.
