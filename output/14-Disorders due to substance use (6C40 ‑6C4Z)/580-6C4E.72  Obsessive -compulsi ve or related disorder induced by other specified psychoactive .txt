6C4E.72  Obsessive -compulsi ve or related disorder induced by other specified psychoactive 


Anxiety disorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance is 
characterised by  anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological 
symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop 
during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from a specified psychoactive 
substance. The intensity or du ration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of 
anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from a 
specified psychoactive substance. The amount and duration of use of the specified 
psychoactive substance must be capable  of producing anxiety symptoms. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety 
and fear -related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), 
as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded th e onset of the use of the 
specified psychoactive substance, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of 
time after cessation of the use of the specified psychoactive substance or 
withdrawal from the specified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence 
of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of 
prior episodes not associated with the use of the specified psychoactive substance).
