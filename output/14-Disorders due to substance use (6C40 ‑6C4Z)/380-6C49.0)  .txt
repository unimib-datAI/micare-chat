Hallucinogen dependence is a disorder of regulation of hallucinogen use arising 
from repeated or continuous use of hallucinogens. The char acteristic feature is a 
strong internal drive to use hallucinogens, which is manifested by impaired ability to 
control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of 
use despite harm or negative consequences. These experienc es are often 
accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use hallucinogens. The 
features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but 
the diagnosis may be made if hallucinogens use is continuous (daily or almost  daily) 
for at least 3 months.
