methcathinone  
Stimulant dependence including amphetamines, methamphetamine or 
methcathinone is a disorder of regulation of stimulant use arising from repeated or 
continuous use of stimulants. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to 
use stimulants, which  is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing 
priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or 
negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective 
sensation of urge or craving to use stimulants. Physiological features of 
dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of stimulants, 
withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of stimulants, or 
repeated use of stimulants or pharmacologically simila r substances to prevent or 
alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident 
over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if stimulant use 
is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
