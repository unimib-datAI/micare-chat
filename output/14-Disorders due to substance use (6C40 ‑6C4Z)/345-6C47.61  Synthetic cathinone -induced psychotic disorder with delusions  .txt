6C47.61  Synthetic cathinone -induced psychotic disorder with delusions  


Synthetic cathinone -induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations is characterised 
by the presence of hallucinations that are judged to be the direct consequence of 
synthetic cathinone use. Neither delusions nor other ps ychotic symptoms are 
present. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during hypnogogic or hypnopompic 
states, are not better accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder 
(e.g., schizophrenia), and are not due to another disorder or disease class ified 
elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms).
