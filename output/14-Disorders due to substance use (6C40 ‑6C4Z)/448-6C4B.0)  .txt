Volatile inhalant dependence is a disorder of regulation of volatile inhalant use 
arising from repeated or continuous use of volatile inhalants. The characteristic 
feature is a strong internal drive to use volatile inhalants, which is manifested by 
impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use o ver other activities 
and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences 
are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use volatile 
inhalants. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, inc luding 
tolerance to the effects of volatile inhalants, withdrawal symptoms following 
cessation or reduction in use of volatile inhalants, or repeated use of volatile 
inhalants or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal 
sympt oms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 
12 months but the diagnosis may be made if volatile inhalant use is continuous 
(daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
