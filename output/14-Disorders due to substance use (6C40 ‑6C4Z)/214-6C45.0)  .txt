Cocaine dependence is a disorder of regulation of cocaine use arising from 
repeated or continuous use of cocaine. The characteristic feature is a strong 
internal drive to use cocaine, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, 
increasing prior ity given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite 
harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a 
subjective sensation of urge or craving to use cocaine. Physiological features of 
dependence may also be prese nt, including tolerance to the effects of cocaine, 
withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of cocaine, or 
repeated use of cocaine or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or 
alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of depen dence are usually evident 
over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if cocaine use is 
continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
