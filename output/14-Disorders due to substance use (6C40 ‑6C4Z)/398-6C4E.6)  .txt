6C4E.6)  


Hallucinogen -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychoti c symptoms 
(e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised 
behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with hallucinogens. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of 
hallucinogen intoxication. The amount and duration of hallucinogen use must be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental di sorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic 
symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of 
the hallucinogen use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the hallucinogen us e, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing 
primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes 
not associated with hallucinogen use).
