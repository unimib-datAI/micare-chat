6C4G.72  Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder induced by unknown or unspecified 


Anxiety disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance is 
characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological 
symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) th at develop 
during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary 
mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear -related disorder, a Depressive disorder 
with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms 
preceded the onset of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of 
the use of the unkno wn or unspecified psychoactive substance or withdrawal from 
the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of 
a pre -existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated w ith the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance).
