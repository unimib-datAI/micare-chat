for a substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the unknown or 
unspecified psychoactive substance or withdrawal from the unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing pr imary 
mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance).
