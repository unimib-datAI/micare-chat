6C45.73  Cocaine -induced impulse control disorder  


Cocaine -induced obsessive -compulsive or relat ed disorder is characterised by 
either repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupations, normally associated with 
anxiety and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours performed in response, 
or by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integume nt (e.g., hair pulling, 
skin picking) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from 
cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of 
analogous disturbances that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxica tion or Cocaine 
withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing 
obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive -compulsive or related 
disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the cocaine 
use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a history of 
prior episodes not associated with cocaine use).
