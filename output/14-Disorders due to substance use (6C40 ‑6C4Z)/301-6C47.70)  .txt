methcathinone  
Stimulant -induced mood disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and 
methcathinone is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated 
mood, decrease d engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased 
energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to 
stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of 
mood disturbances that are  characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant 
withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing 
mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental 
disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipol ar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), 
as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant 
use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evi dence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with use of stimulants).
