6C4B.4  Volatile inhalant withdrawal  


Volatile inhalant intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that 
develops during or shortly after the consumption of a volatile inhalant that is 
characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, 
behaviour, or  coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known 
pharmacological effects of volatile inhalants and their intensity is closely related to 
the amount of volatile inhalant consumed. They are time -limited and abate as the 
volatile inhalant is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include euphoria, 
impaired judgment, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, 
lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, 
psychomotor retardation, and visual disturbance s. Muscle weakness and diplopia 
may occur. Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, 
and death. Inhalants containing lead (e.g. some forms of petrol/gasoline) may cause 
confusion, irritability, coma and seizures.
