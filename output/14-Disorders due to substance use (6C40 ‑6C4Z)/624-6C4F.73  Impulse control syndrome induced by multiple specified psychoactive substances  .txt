6C4F.73  Impulse control syndrome induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances  


psychoactive substances  
Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder induced by multiple specified 
psychoactive substances is characterised by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or 
preocc upations, normally associated with anxiety and typically accompanied by 
repetitive behaviours performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions 
directed at the integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) that develop during or 
soon after intoxi cation with or withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive 
substances. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of 
analogous disturbances that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal 
from the multiple specified  psychoactive substances. The amount and duration of 
the multiple specified psychoactive substances use must be capable of producing 
obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (in particular  an Obsessive -compulsive or related 
disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the use of 
multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the multiple specif ied psychoactive substance use 
or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder 
with obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with multiple specified psychoactive subst ances use).
