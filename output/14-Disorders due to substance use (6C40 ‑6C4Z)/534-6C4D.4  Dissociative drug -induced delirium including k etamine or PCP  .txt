6C4D.4  Dissociative drug -induced delirium including k etamine or PCP  


Dissociative drug intoxication including Ketamine and PCP is a clinically significant 
transient con dition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of a 
dissociative drug that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, 
perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by 
the known pharmacologica l effects of a dissociative drug and their intensity is 
closely related to the amount of the dissociative drug consumed. They are time -
limited and abate as the dissociative drug is cleared from the body. Presenting 
features may include aggression, impulsiv eness, unpredictability, anxiety, 
psychomotor agitation, impaired judgment, numbness or diminished responsiveness 
to pain, slurred speech, and dystonia. Physical signs include nystagmus (repetitive, 
uncontrolled eye movements), tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, numbness, 
ataxia, dysarthria, and muscle rigidity. In rare instances, use of dissociative drugs 
including Ketamine and PCP can result in seizures.
