6C4F.6  Psychotic disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances  


medications  
Delirium induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is characterised by 
an acute state of disturbed attention and awareness with specific features of 
delirium that develops  during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or 
during the use of multiple specified substances. The amount and duration of use of 
the multiple specified substances must be capable of producing delirium. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder, by use of or 
withdrawal from a substance other than those specified, or by another health 
condition that is not classified under Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Note that this diagnosis applies only to th ose situations in which delirium 
is present but it cannot be determined which of multiple psychoactive substances is 
the cause of the delirium. In cases of multiple psychoactive substance use in which 
more than one specific substance can be identified as a  cause of the delirium, the 
corresponding specific substance -induced delirium diagnoses should be given 
instead.  
Coding Note:  Code also the causing condition
