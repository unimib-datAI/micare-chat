6C49.61  Hallucinogen -induced anxiety disorder  


Hallucinogen -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., 
depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon aft er intoxication 
with hallucinogens. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in 
excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of hallucinogen intoxication. 
The amount and duration of hallucinogen use must be capable of producing moo d 
symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might 
be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the hallucinogen use, if 
the symptom s persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
hallucinogen use, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental 
disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with 
hallucinogen use).
