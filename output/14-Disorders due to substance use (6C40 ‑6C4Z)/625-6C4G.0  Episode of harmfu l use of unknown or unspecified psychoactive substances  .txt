6C4G.0  Episode of harmfu l use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances  


Impulse control disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is 
characterised by persistently  repeated behaviours in which there is recurrent failure 
to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, 
at least in the short -term, despite longer -term harm either to the individual or to 
others (e.g., fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, repetitive sexual 
behaviour, aggressive outbursts) that develop during or soon after intoxication with 
or withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive substances. The intensity or 
duration of the symptoms is substant ially in excess of disturbances of impulse 
control that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from the multiple 
specified psychoactive substances. The amount and duration of the multiple 
specified psychoactive substances use must be capable  of producing disturbances 
of impulse control. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental 
disorder (e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), 
as might be the case if the impulse control disturbances preceded  the onset of the 
use of multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms persist for a 
substantial period of time after cessation of the multiple specified psychoactive 
substance use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existin g primary 
mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with multiple specified psychoactive substances use).

substances  
Disorders due to use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances are 
characterised by the pattern and consequences of psychoactive substance use 
when the specific substance is unknown or unspecified. These categories may be 
used in clinical situations  in which it is clear that the disturbance is due to substance 
use but the specific class of substance is unknown. Once the relevant substance is 
identified, the disturbance should be recoded under the appropriate substance 
class.
