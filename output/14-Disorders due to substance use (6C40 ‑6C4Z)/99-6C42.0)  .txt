Synthetic cannabinoid dependence is a disorder of regulation of synthetic 
cannabinoid use arising from repeated or continuous use o f synthetic cannabinoids. 
The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use synthetic cannabinoids, 
which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to 
use over other activities and persistence of use despite har m or negative 
consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective 
sensation of urge or craving to use synthetic cannabinoids. Physiological features of 
dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of synthetic 
cannab inoids, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of 
synthetic cannabinoids, or repeated use of synthetic cannabinoids or 
pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 
The features of dependence are usu ally evident over a period of at least 12 months 
but the diagnosis may be made if synthetic cannabinoid use is continuous (daily or 
almost daily) for at least 3 months.
