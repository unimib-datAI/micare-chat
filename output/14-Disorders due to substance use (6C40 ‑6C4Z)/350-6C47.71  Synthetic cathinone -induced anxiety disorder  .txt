6C47.71  Synthetic cathinone -induced anxiety disorder  


Synthetic cathinone -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms 
(e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from synthetic cathinones. The intensity or duration of the 
symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of 
Synthetic cathinone intoxication or Synthetic cathinone withdrawal. The am ount and 
duration of synthetic cathinone use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. 
The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a 
Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the 
case if  the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic cathinone use, if 
the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the synthetic 
cathinone use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental diso rder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with synthetic cathinone use).
