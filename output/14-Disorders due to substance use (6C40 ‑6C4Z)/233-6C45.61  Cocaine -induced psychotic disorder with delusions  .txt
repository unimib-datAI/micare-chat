6C45.61  Cocaine -induced psychotic disorder with delusions  


Cocaine -induced psych otic disorder with hallucinations is characterised by the 
presence of hallucinations that are judged to be the direct consequence of cocaine 
use. Neither delusions nor other psychotic symptoms are present. The symptoms 
do not occur exclusively during hypno gogic or hypnopompic states, are not better 
accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., schizophrenia), and 
are not due to another disorder or disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with 
visual symptoms).
