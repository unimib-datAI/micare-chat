6C47.4  Synthetic cathinone withdrawal  


Synthetic cathinone intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that 
develops during or shortly after the consumption of synthetic cathinones that is 
characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, 
behaviour,  or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known 
pharmacological effects of synthetic cathinones and their intensity is closely related 
to the amount of synthetic cathinones consumed. They are time -limited and abate 
as the synthetic cathinone i s cleared from the body. Presenting features may 
include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, 
paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, 
transitory confusion, and changes i n sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or 
vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include 
tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesias and 
dystonias, and skin sores. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use of 
synthetic cathinones can result in seizures.
