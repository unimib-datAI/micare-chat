6C44.40  Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal, uncomplicated  


Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic wi thdrawal is a clinically significant cluster of 
symptoms, behaviours and/or physiological features, varying in degree of severity 
and duration, that occurs upon cessation or reduction of use of sedatives, hypnotics 
or anxiolytics in individuals who have de veloped dependence or have used 
sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics for a prolonged period or in large amounts. 
Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal can also occur when prescribed 
sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics have been used in standard therap eutic doses. 
Presenting features of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal may include 
anxiety, psychomotor agitation, insomnia, increased hand tremor, nausea or 
vomiting, and transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations. There 
may be signs of autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, sweating), 
or postural hypotension. The withdrawal state may be complicated by seizures. 
Less commonly, there may be progression to a more severe withdrawal state 
characterised by conf usion and disorientation, delusions, and more prolonged 
visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. In such cases, a separate diagnosis of 
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic -induced delirium should be assigned.
