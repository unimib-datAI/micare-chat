6C47.73  Synthetic cathinon e-induced impulse control disorder  


Synthetic cathinone -induced obsessive -compulsive or related disorder is 
characteri sed by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupations, normally 
associated with anxiety and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours 
performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the 
integument (e.g., hair pulling, s kin picking) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or withdrawal from synthetic cathinones. The intensity or duration 
of the symptoms is substantially in excess of analogous disturbances that are 
characteristic of Synthetic cathinone intoxica tion or Synthetic cathinone withdrawal. 
The amount and duration of synthetic cathinone use must be capable of producing 
obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive -compulsive or related 
disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic 
cathinone use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the synthetic cathinone use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence 
of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with obsessive -compulsive or related 
symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic cathinone 
use).
