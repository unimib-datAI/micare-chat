Alcohol dependence is a disorder of regulation of alcohol use arising from repeated 
or continuous use of alcohol. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to 
use alcohol , which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing 
priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or 
negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective 
sensation of urge or crav ing to use alcohol. Physiological features of dependence 
may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of alcohol, withdrawal 
symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of alcohol, or repeated use of 
alcohol or pharmacologically similar sub stances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal 
symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 
12 months but the diagnosis may be made if alcohol use is continuous (daily or 
almost daily) for at least 3 months.
