6C41.7  Certain specified cannabis -induced mental or behavioural disorders  


Cannabis -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. 
delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) 
that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cannabis. The 
intensit y or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of 
Cannabis intoxication or Cannabis withdrawal. The amount and duration of 
cannabis use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms 
are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood 
disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms 
preceded the onset of the cannabis use, if the  symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the cannabis use or withdrawal, or if there is other 
evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a 
history of prior episodes not associated with cann abis use).
