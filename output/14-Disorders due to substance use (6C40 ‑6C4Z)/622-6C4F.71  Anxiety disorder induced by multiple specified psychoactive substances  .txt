6C4F.71  Anxiety disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances  


Mood disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is 
characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased 
engagement in pleasurable activi ties, increased or decreased energy levels) that 
develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from multiple specified 
psychoactive substances. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially 
in excess of mood disturbances that ar e characteristic of intoxication with or 
withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive substances. The amount and 
duration of use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances must be capable 
of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better ex plained by a primary 
mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective 
disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the 
use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms per sist for a 
substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the multiple specified 
psychoactive substances or withdrawal from the multiple specified psychoactive 
substances, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder 
with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of 
the multiple specified psychoactive substances).
