6C4E.71  Anxiety disorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance  


Mood disorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance is characterised 
by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in 
pleasurable activities, increased o r decreased energy levels) that develop during or 
soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from a specified psychoactive substance. 
The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood 
disturbances that are characteristic of intox ication with or withdrawal from a 
specified psychoactive substance. The amount and duration of use of the specified 
psychoactive substance must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g.,  a Depressive 
disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the 
mood symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the specified psychoactive 
substance, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation  of 
the use of the specified psychoactive substance or withdrawal from the specified 
psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with t he use of the specified psychoactive substance).
