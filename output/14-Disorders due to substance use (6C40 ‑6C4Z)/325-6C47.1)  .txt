Synthetic cathinone dependence is a disorder of regulation of synthetic cathinone 
use arising from repeated or continuous use of synthetic cathinones. The 
characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use synthetic cat hinones, which is 
manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over 
other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. 
These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or 
craving to use synthetic cathinones. Physiological features of dependence may also 
be present, including tolerance to the effects of synthetic cathinones, withdrawal 
symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of synthetic cathinones, or 
repeated u se of synthetic cathinones or pharmacologically similar substances to 
prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually 
evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if 
synthetic cathinone use is c ontinuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
