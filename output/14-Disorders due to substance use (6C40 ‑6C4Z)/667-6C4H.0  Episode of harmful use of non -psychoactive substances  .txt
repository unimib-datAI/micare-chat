6C4H.0  Episode of harmful use of non -psychoactive substances  


substance  
Impulse control disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance is characterised by persistently repeated behaviours in which there is 
recurrent failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is 
rewarding to the perso n, at least in the short -term, despite longer -term harm either 
to the individual or to others (e.g., fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, 
repetitive sexual behaviour, aggressive outbursts) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or  withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), as might 
be the case if the impulse control d isturbances preceded the onset of the unknown 
or unspecified psychoactive substance use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of use or withdrawal of the unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance, or if there is othe r evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance use).

  6C4H   Disorders due to use of non -psychoactive substances  
Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances are characterised by the 
pattern and consequences of non -medical use of non -psychoactive substances. 
Non-psychoactive substances include laxatives, anabolic steroids, growth hormone, 
erythropoietin, and non -steroidal anti -inflam matory drugs. They may also include 
proprietary or over -the-counter medicines and folk remedies. Non -medical use of 
these substances may be associated with harm to the individual due to the direct or 
secondary toxic effects of the non -psychoactive substanc e on body organs and 
systems, or a harmful route of administration (e.g., infections due to intravenous 
self-administration). They are not associated with intoxication or with a dependence 
or withdrawal syndrome and are not recognized causes of substance -induced 
mental disorders.
