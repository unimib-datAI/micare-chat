6C4B.71  Volatile inhalant -induced anxiety disorder  


Volatile in halant -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., 
depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from v olatile inhalants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms 
is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Volatile 
inhalant intoxication or Volatile inhalant withdrawal. The amount and duration of 
volatile inhalant use must be  capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms 
are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a 
Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood 
symptoms preceded the onset of the volatil e inhalant use, if the symptoms persist 
for a substantial period of time after cessation of the volatile inhalant use or 
withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder 
with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episod es not associated with volatile 
inhalant use).
