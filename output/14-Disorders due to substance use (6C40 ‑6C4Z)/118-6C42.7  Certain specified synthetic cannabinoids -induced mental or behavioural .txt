6C42.7  Certain specified synthetic cannabinoids -induced mental or behavioural 


Synthetic cannabinoid -induced psychoti c disorder is characterised by psychotic 
symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly 
disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids. The intensity or durat ion of the symptoms 
is substantially in excess of psychotic -like disturbances of perception, cognition, or 
behaviour that are characteristic of Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication or Synthetic 
cannabinoid withdrawal. The amount and duration of synthetic can nabinoid use 
must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better 
explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with 
psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the 
onset of the synthetic cannabinoid use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the synthetic cannabinoid use or withdrawal, or if 
there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with psychotic 
symptoms (e .g., a history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic 
cannabinoid use).
