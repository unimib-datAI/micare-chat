6C47.0  Episode of harmful use of synthetic cathinones  


methamphetamine or methcathinone  
Stimulant -induced impulse control disorder including amphetamines, 
methamphetamine and methcathinone i s characterised by persistently repeated 
behaviours in which there is recurrent failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to 
perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short -term, despite 
longer -term harm either to the individual or  to others (e.g., fire setting or stealing 
without apparent motive, repetitive sexual behaviour, aggressive outbursts) that 
develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from stimulants. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substanti ally in excess of disturbances of 
impulse control that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant 
withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing 
disturbances of impulse control. The symptoms are not better explained by a 
primary mental disorder (e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to 
addictive behaviours), as might be the case if the impulse control disturbances 
preceded the onset of the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other 
evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with impulse control symptoms 
(e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with stimulant use).

  6C47   Disorders due to use of synthetic cathinones  
Disorders due to use of synthetic cathinones are characterised by the pattern and 
consequences o f synthetic cathinone use. Synthetic cathinones (also known as 
‘bath salts’) are synthetic compounds with stimulant properties related to cathinone 
found in the khat plant, Catha edulis. The use of synthetic cathinones is common in 
young populations in man y countries. They may produce a range of disorders 
including Synthetic Cathinone Intoxication, Synthetic Cathinone Dependence and 
Synthetic Cathinone Withdrawal. Several synthetic cathinone -induced mental 
disorders are recognised.
