Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence is a disorde r of regulation of sedative 
use arising from repeated or continuous use of these substances. The characteristic 
feature is a strong internal drive to use sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, which is 
manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasi ng priority given to use over 
other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. 
These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or 
craving to use these substances. Physiological features of dependence may also be 
present, including tolerance to the effects of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics, 
withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use, or repeated use of 
sedatives or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdr awal 
symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 
12 months but the diagnosis may be made if sedative use is continuous (daily or 
almost daily) for at least 3 months.
