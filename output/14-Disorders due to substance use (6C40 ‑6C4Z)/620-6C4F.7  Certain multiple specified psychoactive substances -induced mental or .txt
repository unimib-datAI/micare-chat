6C4F.7  Certain multiple specified psychoactive substances -induced mental or 


Psychotic disorde r induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is 
characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised 
thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or withdrawal from m ultiple specified psychoactive substances. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of 
intoxication with or withdrawal from multiple s pecified psychoactive substances. The 
amount and duration of use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances must 
be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better 
explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a M ood disorder with 
psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the 
onset of the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances, if the symptoms 
persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the use of th e multiple 
specified psychoactive substances or withdrawal from the multiple specified 
psychoactive substances, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associate d with the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances).
