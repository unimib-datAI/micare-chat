6C40.62  Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder with mixed psychotic symptoms  


Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder with delusions is characterised by the presence 
of delusions that are judged to be the direct consequence of alcohol use. Neither 
hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms are present. The symptoms do not 
occur exclusively during hypnogogic or hypnopompic states, are not better 
accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., schizophrenia), and 
are not due to anothe r disorder or disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with 
visual symptoms).
