6C4F.72  Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder induced by multiple specified 


Anxiety disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive substances is 
characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological 
symptoms of excessive auton omic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop 
during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from multiple specified 
psychoactive substances. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially 
in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characte ristic of intoxication with or 
withdrawal from multiple specified psychoactive substances. The amount and 
duration of use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances must be capable 
of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained  by a 
primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear -related disorder, a Depressive 
disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety 
symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the multiple specified psychoactive 
substances,  if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation 
of the use of the multiple specified psychoactive substances or withdrawal from the 
multiple specified psychoactive substances, or if there is other evidence of a pre -
existing primar y mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with the use of the multiple specified psychoactive 
substances).
