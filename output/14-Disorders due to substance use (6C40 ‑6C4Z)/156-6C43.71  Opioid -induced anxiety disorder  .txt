6C43.71  Opioid -induced anxiety disorder  


Opioid -induced mood disor der is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed 
or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or 
decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from opioids. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in 
excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Opioid intoxication or Opioid 
withdrawal. The amount and duration of opioid use must be capable of producing 
mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better expl ained by a primary mental 
disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), 
as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the opioid use, if 
the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after c essation of the opioid 
use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental 
disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with 
opioid use).
