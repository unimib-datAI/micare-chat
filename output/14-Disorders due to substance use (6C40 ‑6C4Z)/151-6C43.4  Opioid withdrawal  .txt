6C43.4  Opioid withdrawal  


Opioid intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during 
or shortly after the consumption of opioids that is cha racterised by disturbances in 
consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These 
disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of opioids and their 
intensity is closely related to the amount of opioids consumed. They are time -limited 
and abate as opioids are cleared from the body. Presenting features may include 
somnolence, stupor, mood changes (e.g. euphoria followed by apathy and 
dysphoria), psychomotor retardation, impaired judgment, respiratory depression, 
slurred speech, and impairment of memory and attention. In severe intoxication 
coma may ensue. A characteristic physical sign is pupillary constriction but this sign 
may be absent when intoxication is due to synthetic opioids. Severe opioid 
intoxication can l ead to death due to respiratory depression.
