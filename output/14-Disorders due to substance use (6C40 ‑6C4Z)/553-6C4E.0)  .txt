Other specified psychoactive substance dependence is a disorder of regulation of 
use of a specified substance arising from repeated or continuous use of the 
specified substance. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use the 
specified s ubstance, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, 
increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite 
harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a 
subjective sensation of urge  or craving to use the specified substance. Physiological 
features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of 
the specified substance, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in 
use of the specified substance, or repeated use of the specified substance or 
pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 
The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months 
but the diagnosis may be made if use of the spec ified substance is continuous (daily 
or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
