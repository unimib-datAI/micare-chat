6C41.71  Cannabis -induced anxiety disorder  


Cannabis -induced mood disorder is charac terised by mood symptoms (e.g., 
depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from cannabis. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is 
substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Cannabis 
intoxication or Cannabis withdrawal. The amount and duration of cannabis use must 
be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, 
Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the 
onset of the cannabis use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time 
after cessa tion of the cannabis use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a 
pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with cannabis use).
