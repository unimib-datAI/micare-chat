6C47.6Z  Synthetic cathinone -induced psychotic disorder, unspecified

characterised by the presence of multiple psychotic symptoms, primarily 
hallucinations and delusions, when these are ju dged to be the direct consequence 
of synthetic cathinone use. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during 
hypnogogic or hypnopompic states, are not better accounted for by another mental 
and behavioural disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia), and are not due to a nother disorder 
or disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms).
