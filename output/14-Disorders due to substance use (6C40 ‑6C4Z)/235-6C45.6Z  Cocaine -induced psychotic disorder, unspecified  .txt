6C45.6Z  Cocaine -induced psychotic disorder, unspecified  


Cocaine -induced psychotic disorder with mixed psychotic symptoms is 
characterised by the presence of multiple psychotic symptoms, primarily 
hallucinations and delusions, when these are judged to be the direct consequence 
of cocaine use. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during hypnogogic or 
hypnopompic stat es, are not better accounted for by another mental and 
behavioural disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia), and are not due to another disorder or 
disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms).
