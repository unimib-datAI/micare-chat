6C4C.7  Certain specified MDMA or related drug -induced mental or behavioural 


MDMA or related drug -induced psychotic disorder, including MDA is characterised 
by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delus ions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, 
grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with 
MDMA or related drugs. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in 
excess of psychotic -like disturbances of p erception, cognition, or behaviour that are 
characteristic of MDMA or related drug intoxication. The amount and duration of 
MDMA or related drug use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., 
Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if 
the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the MDMA or related drug use, if the 
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the MDMA  or 
related drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental 
disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated 
with MDMA or related drug use, including MDA).
