6C40.71  Alcohol -induced anxiety disorder  


Alcohol -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., 
depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in plea surable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from alcohol. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is 
substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of A lcohol 
intoxication or Alcohol withdrawal. The amount and duration of alcohol use must be 
capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a 
primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, 
Schizoaffecti ve disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the 
onset of the alcohol use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time 
after cessation of the alcohol use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a 
pre-existing primar y mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with alcohol use).
