6C4E.73  Impulse control d isorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance  


substance  
Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder induced by other specified psychoactive 
substance is characterised by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupations, 
normally associa ted with anxiety and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours 
performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the 
integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or withdrawal from a specified psychoactive substance. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of analogous 
disturbances that are characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from the 
specified psychoactive substance. The amount and dur ation of the specified 
psychoactive substance use must be capable of producing obsessive -compulsive or 
related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental 
disorder (in particular an Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder), as migh t be the 
case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the specified psychoactive substance 
use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of use or 
withdrawal of the specified psychoactive substance, or if there is other eviden ce of a 
pre-existing primary mental disorder with obsessive -compulsive or related 
symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with specified 
psychoactive substance use).
