6C4F.0  Episode of harmful use of multiple specified psychoactive substances  


Impulse control disorder induced by other specified psychoactive substance is 
characterised by persistently repeated behaviours in which there is recurrent failure 
to resist an impulse, drive, or ur ge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, 
at least in the short -term, despite longer -term harm either to the individual or to 
others (e.g., fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, repetitive sexual 
behaviour, aggressive outbursts) tha t develop during or soon after intoxication with 
or withdrawal from a specified psychoactive substance. The intensity or duration of 
the symptoms is substantially in excess of disturbances of impulse control that are 
characteristic of intoxication with or withdrawal from the specified psychoactive 
substance. The amount and duration of the specified psychoactive substance use 
must be capable of producing disturbances of impulse control. The symptoms are 
not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g. , an Impulse control disorder, 
a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), as might be the case if the impulse control 
disturbances preceded the onset of the specified psychoactive substance use, if the 
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of use or 
withdrawal of the specified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a 
pre-existing primary mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history 
of prior episodes not associated with specified psychoactive subs tance use).

   6C4F   Disorders due to use of multiple specified psychoactive substances, 
including medications  
Disorders due to use of multiple specified psychoactive substances, including 
medications are characterised by the pattern and consequen ces of multiple 
psychoactive substances. Although this grouping is provided for coding purposes, in 
most clinical situations it is recommended that multiple specific disorders due to 
substance use be assigned rather than using categories from this grouping .
