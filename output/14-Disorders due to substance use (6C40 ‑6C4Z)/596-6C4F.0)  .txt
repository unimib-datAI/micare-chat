Multiple specified psychoactive substance dependence is a disorder of regulation of 
use of multiple specified substances arising from repeated or cont inuous use of the 
specified substances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use the 
specified substances, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, 
increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of  use despite 
harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a 
subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the specified substances. 
Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to 
the effects o f the specified substances, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or 
reduction in use of the specified substances, or repeated use of the specified 
substances or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate 
withdrawal symptoms. The featur es of dependence are usually evident over a 
period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if use of the specified 
substances is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
