6C4G.73  Impulse control disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive 


psychoactive substance  
Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder induced by unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance is characterised by either repetitive intrusive thoughts or 
preoccupations, normally associated with anxiety and typically accompanied by 
repetitive behaviour s performed in response, or by recurrent and habitual actions 
directed at the integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin picking) that develop during or 
soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance. The symptom s are not better explained by a primary 
mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive -compulsive or related disorder), as 
might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the unknown or 
unspecified psychoactive substance use, if the symptoms persist f or a substantial 
period of time after cessation of use or withdrawal of the unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a histor y of 
prior episodes not associated with the unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance use).
