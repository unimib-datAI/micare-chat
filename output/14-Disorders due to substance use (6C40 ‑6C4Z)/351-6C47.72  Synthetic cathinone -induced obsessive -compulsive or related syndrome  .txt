6C47.72  Synthetic cathinone -induced obsessive -compulsive or related syndrome  


Synthetic cathinone -induced anxiety disorder is char acterised by anxiety symptoms 
(e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic 
arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from synthetic cathinones. The intensity or dura tion of the symptoms is 
substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of Synthetic 
cathinone intoxication or Synthetic cathinone withdrawal. The amount and duration 
of synthetic cathinone use must be capable of producing anxiety sympt oms. The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety 
and fear -related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), 
as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic 
cathinone use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the synthetic cathinone use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence 
of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of 
prior epis odes not associated with synthetic cathinone use).
