6C4C.71  MDMA or related drug -induced anxiety disorder  


MDMA or related drug -induced mood diso rder, including MDA is characterised by 
mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in 
pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or 
soon after intoxication with MDMA or related drugs. The in tensity or duration of the 
symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of 
MDMA or related drug intoxication, including MDA. The amount and duration of 
MDMA or related drug use must be capable of producing mood symptoms.  The 
symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive 
disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the 
mood symptoms preceded the onset of the MDMA or related drug use, if the 
symptoms p ersist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the MDMA or 
related drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental 
disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with 
MDMA or related drug use).
