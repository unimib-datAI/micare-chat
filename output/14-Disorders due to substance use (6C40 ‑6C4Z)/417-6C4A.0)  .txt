Nicotine dependence is a disorder of regulation of nicotine use arising from 
repeated or continuous use of nicotine. The characteristic feature is a strong 
internal drive to use nicotine,  which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, 
increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite 
harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a 
subjective sensation of urge or cravi ng to use nicotine. Physiological features of 
dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of nicotine, 
withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of nicotine, or 
repeated use of nicotine or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or 
alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident 
over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if nicotine use is 
continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
