6C42. 3 Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication  
Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that 
develops during or shortly after the consumption of synthetic cannabinoids that is 
characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, 
behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known 
pharmacological effects of synthetic cannabinoids and their intensity is closely 
related to the amount of synthetic cannabinoid consumed. They are time -limited and 
abate as synthetic cannabinoid is cleared from the body. Presenting features may 
include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgment, perceptual 
alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of time), change s in 
sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary experiences, 
impaired short -term memory, and sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival 
injection (red or bloodshot eyes) and tachycardia. Intoxication with synthetic 
cannabi noids may also cause delirium or acute psychosis.
