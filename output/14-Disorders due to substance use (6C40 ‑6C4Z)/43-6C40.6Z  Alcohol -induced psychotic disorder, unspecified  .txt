6C40.6Z  Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder, unspecified  


Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder with mixed psychot ic symptoms is characterised 
by the presence of multiple psychotic symptoms, primarily hallucinations and 
delusions, when these are judged to be the direct consequence of alcohol use. The 
symptoms do not occur exclusively during hypnogogic or hypnopompic s tates, are 
not better accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., 
schizophrenia), and are not due to another disorder or disease classified elsewhere 
(e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms).
