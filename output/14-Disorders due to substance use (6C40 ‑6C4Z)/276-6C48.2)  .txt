Stimulant intoxication including amphetamines, methamphetamine and 
methcathinone but excluding caffeine, cocaine and synthetic cathinones is a 
clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the 
consumption of amphetamine o r other stimulants that is characterised by 
disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or 
coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects 
of amphetamine or other stimulants and their intensity is closely related to the 
amount of amphetamine or other stimulant consumed. They are time -limited and 
abate as amphetamine or another stimulant is cleared from the body. Presenting 
features may include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, 
psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient 
auditory hallucinations, transitory confusion, and changes in sociability. Perspiration 
or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs  
may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesias 
and dystonias, and skin sores. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use 
of stimulants including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone can
