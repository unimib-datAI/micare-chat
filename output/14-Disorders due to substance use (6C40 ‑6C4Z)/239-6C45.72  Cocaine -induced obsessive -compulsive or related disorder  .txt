6C45.72  Cocaine -induced obsessive -compulsive or related disorder  


Cocaine -induced anxiety disorder is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., 
apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic 
arousal, a voidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially 
in excess of anxiety symptoms that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or 
Cocaine withdraw al. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of 
producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary 
mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear -related disorder, a Depressive disorder 
with prominent anxiety symptoms) , as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms 
preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other 
evidence of a pre -existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a 
history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use).
