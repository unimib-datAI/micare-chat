Cannabis dependence is a disorder of regulation of cannabis use arising from 
repeated or continuous use of cannabis. The characteristic feature is a strong 
internal drive to use cannabis, which is mani fested by impaired ability to control use, 
increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite 
harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a 
subjective sensation of urge or craving to use cann abis. Physiological features of 
dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of cannabis, 
withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of cannabis, or 
repeated use of cannabis or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or 
alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident 
over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if cannabis use 
is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
