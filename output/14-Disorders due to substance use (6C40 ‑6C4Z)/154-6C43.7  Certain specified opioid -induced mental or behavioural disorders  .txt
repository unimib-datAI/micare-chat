6C43.7  Certain specified opioid -induced mental or behavioural disorders  


Opioid -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. 
delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) 
that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdr awal from opioids. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Opioid 
intoxication or Opioid withdrawal. The amount and duration of op ioid use must be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic 
symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of  
the opioid use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the opioid use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -
existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior 
episodes not  associated with opioid use).
