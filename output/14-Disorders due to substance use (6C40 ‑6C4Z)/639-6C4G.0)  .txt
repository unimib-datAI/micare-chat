Unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance dependence is a disorder of 
regulation of use of an unknown or unspecified substance arising from repeated or 
continuous use of the substance. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive 
to use the unknown or unspecified substance, which is manifested by impaired 
ability to control use, increasing priorit y given to use over other activities and 
persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are 
often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the unknown 
or unspecified substance. The features of dependence are usually evident over a 
period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if use of the unknown 
or unspecified substance is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
