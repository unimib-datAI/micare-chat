or methcathinone with delusions  
Stimulant -induced psychotic disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine 
and methcathinone is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, 
hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop 
during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The intensity or 
duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like disturbances of 
perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or 
Stimula nt withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of 
producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a 
primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic 
symptoms), as might be the case  if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of 
the stimulant use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -
existing primary mental disorder with ps ychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with use of stimulants).
