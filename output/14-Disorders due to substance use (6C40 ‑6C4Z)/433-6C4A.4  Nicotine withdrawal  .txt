Nicotine intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during  
or shortly after the consumption of nicotine that is characterised by disturbances in 
consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These 
disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of nicotine and their 
intens ity is closely related to the amount of nicotine consumed. They are time -

include restlessness, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, cold sweats, headache, 
insomnia, palpitations, pa resthesias, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, 
confusion, bizarre dreams, burning sensations in the mouth, and salivation. In rare 
instances, paranoid ideation, perceptual disturbances, convulsions or coma may 
occur. Nicotine intoxication occurs more co mmonly in na√Øve (non -tolerant) users or 
among those taking higher than accustomed doses.
