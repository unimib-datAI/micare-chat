Dissociative drug dependence including ketamine or PCP is a disorder of regulation 
of dissociat ive drug use arising from repeated or continuous use of dissociative 
drugs. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use dissociative drugs, 
which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to 
use over other  activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative 
consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective 
sensation of urge or craving to use dissociative drugs. The features of dependence 
are usually evident over a period of at lea st 12 months but the diagnosis may be 
made if dissociative drugs use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 
months.
