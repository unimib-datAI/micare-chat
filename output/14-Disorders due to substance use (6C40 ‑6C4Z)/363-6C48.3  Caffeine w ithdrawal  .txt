6C48.3  Caffeine w ithdrawal  


Caffeine intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops 
during or shortly after the consumption of caffeine that is characterised by 
disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or 
coordi nation. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects 
of caffeine and their intensity is closely related to the amount of caffeine consumed. 
They are time -limited and abate as caffeine is cleared from the body. Presenting 
features may include restlessness, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, 
tachycardia, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle twitching, psychomotor 
agitation, perspiration or chills, and nausea or vomiting. Cardiac arrhythmias may 
occur. Disturbances ty pical of intoxication tend to occur at relatively higher doses 
(e.g., > 1 g per day). Very high doses of caffeine (e.g., > 5 g) can result in 
respiratory distress or seizures and can be fatal.
