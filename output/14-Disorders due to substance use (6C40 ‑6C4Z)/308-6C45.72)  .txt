amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone  
Stimulant -induced obsessive -compulsive or related disorder including 
amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone is characterised by either 
repetitive intrusive thoughts or preoccupa tions, normally associated with anxiety 
and typically accompanied by repetitive behaviours performed in response, or by 
recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g., hair pulling, skin 
picking) that develop during or soon after intoxicat ion with or withdrawal from 
stimulants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of 
analogous disturbances that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant 
withdrawal. The amount and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing 
obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive -compulsive or related 
disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the  stimulant 
use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with obsessive -compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a hist ory of 
prior episodes not associated with stimulant use).
