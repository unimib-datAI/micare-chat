methcathinone  
Stimulant -induced anxiety disorder including amphetamines, methamphetamine and 
methcathinone is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, 
fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) 
that develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal due to stimulants. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety symptoms 
that are characteristic of Stimulant intoxication or Stimulant withdrawal. The amount 
and duration of stimulant use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The 
symptoms are n ot better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety 
and fear -related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), 
as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the stimulant 
use, if the symptoms pers ist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
stimulant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with use of stimulants) .
