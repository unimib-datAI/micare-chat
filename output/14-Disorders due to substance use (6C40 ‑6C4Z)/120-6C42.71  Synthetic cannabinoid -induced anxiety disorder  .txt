6C42.71  Synthetic cannabinoid -induced anxiety disorder  


Synthetic cannabinoid -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms 
(e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids. The intensity or duration of the 
symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of 
Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication or Synthe tic cannabinoid withdrawal. The amount 
and duration of synthetic cannabinoid use must be capable of producing mood 
symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffectiv e disorder), as might 
be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic cannabinoid 
use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the 
synthetic cannabinoid use or withdrawal, or if there is other eviden ce of a pre -
existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with synthetic cannabinoid use).
