6C4C.4  MDMA or related drug withdrawal, including MDA  


MDMA or related drug intoxication, including MDA is a clinically significant transient 
condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of  MDMA or related 
drugs that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, 
affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known 
pharmacological effects of MDMA or related drugs and their intensity is clo sely 
related to the amount of MDMA or a related drug consumed. They are time -limited 
and abate as MDMA or a related drug is cleared from the body. Presenting features 
may include increased or inappropriate sexual interest and activity, anxiety, 
restlessnes s, agitation, and sweating. In rare instances, usually in severe 
intoxication, use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA can result in dystonia 
and seizures. Sudden death is a rare but recognised complication.
