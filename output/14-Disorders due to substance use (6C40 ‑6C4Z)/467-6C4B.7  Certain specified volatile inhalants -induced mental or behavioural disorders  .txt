6C4B.7  Certain specified volatile inhalants -induced mental or behavioural disorders  


Volatile inhalant -induced psychotic disorder is characterised b y psychotic symptoms 
(e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized 
behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from 
volatile inhalants. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantial ly in 
excess of psychotic -like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are 
characteristic of Volatile inhalant intoxication or Volatile inhalant withdrawal. The 
amount and duration of volatile inhalant use must be capable of producing psyc hotic 
symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the 
case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the volatile inhalant use, if 
the symptom s persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the volatile 
inhalant use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not 
associated with vol atile inhalant use).
