continuous use of opioids. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use 
opioids, which i s manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority 
given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative 
consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective 
sensation of urge or craving to us e opioids. Physiological features of dependence 
may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of opioids, withdrawal 
symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of opioids, or repeated use of 
opioids or pharmacologically similar substances t o prevent or alleviate withdrawal 
symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 
12 months but the diagnosis may be made if opioid use is continuous (daily or 
almost daily) for at least 3 months.
