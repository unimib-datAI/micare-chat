6C44.71  Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic -induced anxiety disorder  


Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood 
symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in 
pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or 
soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics. 
The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood 
disturbances that are characteristic of intoxication or withdrawal due to sedatives, 
hypnotics or anxiolytics. The amount and duration of sedative, hypnotic or anx iolytic 
use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better 
explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar 
disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms 
preceded the o nset of the sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic use, if the symptoms 
persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the sedative, hypnotic or 
anxiolytic use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary 
mental disorder wi th mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not 
associated with sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic use).
