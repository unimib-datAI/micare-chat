6C40.60  Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations  


Alcohol -induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g. 
delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, gros sly disorganised behaviour) 
that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from alcohol. The 
intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic -like 
disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Alcohol 
intoxication or Alcohol withdrawal. The amount and duration of alcohol use must be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g. Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder wi th psychotic 
symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of 
the alcohol use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after 
cessation of the alcohol use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre -
existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g. a history of prior 
episodes not associated with alcohol use).
