6C45.71  Cocaine -induced anxiety disorder  


Cocaine -induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., 
depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, 
increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxic ation 
with or withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is 
substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Cocaine 
intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must 
be capable o f producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained 
by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, 
Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the 
onset of the cocaine use, if t he symptoms persist for a substantial period of time 
after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a 
pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior 
episodes not associated with cocaine  use).
