6C4G.7  Certain unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance -induced mental or 


substance  
Psychotic disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance is 
characterised  by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised 
thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after 
intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance. The symptoms are not be tter explained by a primary mental disorder 
(e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the 
case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the unknown or 
unspecified psychoactive substance, if the symptoms p ersist for a substantial period 
of time after cessation of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substance or withdrawal from the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, 
or if there is other evidence of a pre -existing primary mental dis order with psychotic 
symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of the 
unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance).
