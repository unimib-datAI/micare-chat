6C91.00  Conduct -dissocial disorder, childhood onset with limited prosocial emotions  


Conduct -dissocial disorder, childhood onset is characterised by a repetitive and 
persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age -
appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws are violated such as aggression towards 
people or animals; destruction of property; deceitfulness or theft; and serious 
violations of rules. To be diagnosed, features of the  disorder must be present during 
childhood prior to adolescence (e.g., before 10 years of age) and the behaviour 
pattern must be enduring over a significant period of time (e.g., 12 months or more). 
Isolated dissocial or criminal acts are thus not in thems elves grounds for the 
diagnosis.
