6C91.10  Conduct -dissocial disorder, adolescent onset with limit ed prosocial emotions  


Conduct -dissocial disorder, adolescent onset is characterised by a repetitive and 
persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age -
appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws are violat ed such as aggression towards 
people or animals; destruction of property; deceitfulness or theft; and serious 
violations of rules. No features of the disorder are present during childhood prior to 
adolescence (e.g., before 10 years of age). To be diagnosed , the behaviour pattern 
must be enduring over a significant period of time (e.g., 12 months or more). 
Isolated dissocial or criminal acts are thus not in themselves grounds for the 
diagnosis.
