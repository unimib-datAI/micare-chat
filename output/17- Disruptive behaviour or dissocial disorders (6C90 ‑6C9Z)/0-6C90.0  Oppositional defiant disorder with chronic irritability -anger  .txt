  6C90   Oppositional defiant disorder  
Oppositional defiant disorder is a persistent pattern (e.g., 6 months or more)  of 
markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative or spiteful behaviour that occurs more 
frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and 
developmental level and that is not restricted to interaction with siblings. 
Oppositional defia nt disorder may be manifest in prevailing, persistent angry or 
irritable mood, often accompanied by severe temper outbursts or in headstrong, 
argumentative and defiant behaviour. The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity 
to result in significant impa irment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning
