6C90.11  Oppositional defiant disorder without chronic irritability -anger with typical prosocial 


emotions  
All definitional requirements for oppositional defiant disorder without chronic 
irritability -anger are met. In addition, the individual exhibits characteristic s that are 
sometimes referred to as ‘callous and unemotional’. These characteristics include a 
lack of empathy or sensitivity to the feelings of others and a lack of concern for 
others’ distress; a lack of remorse, shame or guilt over their own behaviour ( unless 
prompted by being apprehended), a relative indifference to the probability of 
punishment; a lack of concern over poor performance in school or work; and limited 
expression of emotions, particularly positive or loving feelings toward others, or only 
doing so in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or instrumental. This pattern is 
pervasive across situations and relationships (i.e., the qualifier should not be 
applied based on a single characteristic, a single relationship, or a single instance of 
behavi our) and is persistent over time (e.g., at least 1 year).
