  6C91   Conduct -dissocial disorder  
Conduct -dissocial disorder is characterised by a repetitive and persistent pattern of 
behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age -appropriate societal 
norms, rules, or laws are violated such as aggression towards people or animals; 
destruction of property; deceitfulness or theft; and serious violations of rules. The 
behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity t o result in significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning. To be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be enduring over a 
significant period of time (e.g., 12 months or more). Isolated  dissocial or criminal 
acts are thus not in themselves grounds for the diagnosis.
