6C90.00  Oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability -anger with limited prosocial 


All definitional requirements for oppositional defiant disorder are met. This form o f 
oppositional defiant disorder is characterised by prevailing, persistent angry or 
irritable mood that may be present independent of any apparent provocation. The 
negative mood is often accompanied by regularly occurring severe temper outbursts 
that are g rossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the provocation. Chronic 
irritability and anger are characteristic of the individual’s functioning nearly every 
day, are observable across multiple settings or domains of functioning (e.g., home, 
school,  social relationships), and are not restricted to the individual’s relationship 
with his/her parents or guardians. The pattern of chronic irritability and anger is not 
limited to occasional episodes (e.g., developmentally typical irritability) or discrete 
periods (e.g., irritable mood in the context of manic or depressive episodes).
