symptoms is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type I 
disorder h ave been met and the current episode is depressive at a moderate level

lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty 
concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, 
hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, 
psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a moderate 
depressive episode, several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a

present overall. The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in 
multiple domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other 
important domains).
