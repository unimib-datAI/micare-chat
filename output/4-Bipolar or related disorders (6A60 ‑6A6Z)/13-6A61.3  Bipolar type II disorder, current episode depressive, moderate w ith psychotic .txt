Bipolar type II disorder, current episode depressive, moderate, without psychotic 
symptoms is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type II 
disorder have been met and the cur rent episode is depressive at a moderate level 
of severity and there are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode. A 
depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished 
interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period 
lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty 
concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, 
hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appe tite or sleep, 
psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a moderate 
depressive episode, several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a 
marked degree, or a large number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are 
present overall. The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in 
multiple domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other 
important domains).
