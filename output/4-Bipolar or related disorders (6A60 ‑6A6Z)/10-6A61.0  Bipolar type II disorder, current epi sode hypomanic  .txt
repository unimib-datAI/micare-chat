one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode. A 
hypomanic episode is a persistent mood state lasting for at least several days 
characterised by persist ent elevation of mood or increased irritability as well as 
increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy, accompanied by 
other characteristic symptoms such as increased talkativeness, rapid or racing 
thoughts, increased self -esteem, dec reased need for sleep, distractability, and 
impulsive or reckless behavior. The symptoms represent a change from the 
individualâ€™s typical mood, energy level, and behavior but are not severe enough to 
cause marked impairment in functioning. A depressive epi sode is characterised by 
a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the 
day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by 
other symptoms such as changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or 
retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthless or excessive or inappropriate guilt, feelings
