  6A60   Bipolar type I disorder  
Bipolar type I disorder is an episodic mood disorder defined by the occurrence of 
one or more manic or mixed episodes. A manic episode is an extreme mood state 
lasting at least one week unless shortened by a treatment intervention 
characterised by euphoria , irritability, or expansiveness, and by increased activity or 
a subjective experience of increased energy, accompanied by other characteristic 
symptoms such as rapid or pressured speech, flight of ideas, increased self -esteem 
or grandiosity, decreased nee d for sleep, distractibility, impulsive or reckless 
behaviour, and rapid changes among different mood states (i.e., mood lability). A 
mixed episode is characterised by the presence of several prominent manic and 
several prominent depressive symptoms consis tent with those observed in manic 
episodes and depressive episodes, which either occur simultaneously or alternate 
very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day). Symptoms must include an 
altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressive episode (i.e., 
depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present most of the 
day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by a 
treatment intervention. Although the diagnosis can be made based on evidence of a  
single manic or mixed episode, typically manic or mixed episodes alternate with 
depressive episodes over the course of the disorder.
