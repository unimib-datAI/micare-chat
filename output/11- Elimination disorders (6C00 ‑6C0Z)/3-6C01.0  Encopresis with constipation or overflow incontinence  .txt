6C01.0  Encopresis with constipation or overflow incontinence  


Nocturnal and diurnal enuresis refers  to repeated voiding of urine into clothes or 
bed that occurs both during sleep (i.e., during the night) and during waking hours in 
an individual who has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is 
ordinarily expected (5 years). The urinary inco ntinence may have been present from 
birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have 
arisen following a period of acquired bladder control. In most cases, the behaviour 
is involuntary but in some cases it appears intentiona l.

  6C01   Encopresis  
Encopresis is the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places. Encopresis 
should be diagnosed if inappropriate passage of faeces occurs repeatedly (e.g., at 
least once per month over a period of several months) in an individual who has 
reached the d evelopmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily expected (4 
years). The faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical 
extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of 
acquired bowel contr ol. Encopresis should not be diagnosed if faecal soiling is fully 
attributable to another health condition (e.g., aganglionic megacolon, spina bifida, 
dementia), congenital or acquired abnormalities of the bowel, gastrointestinal 
infection, or excessive us e of laxatives.
