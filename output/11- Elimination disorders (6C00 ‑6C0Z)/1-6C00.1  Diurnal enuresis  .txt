6C00.1  Diurnal enuresis  


Nocturnal enuresis refers to repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed that oc curs 
only during sleep (i.e., during the night) in an individual who has reached a 
developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (5 years). The 
urinary incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of 
normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired 
bladder control. In most cases, the behaviour is involuntary but in some cases it 
appears intentional.
