6C00.2  Nocturnal and diurnal enuresis  


Diurnal enuresis refers to repeated voiding of urine into clothes that occurs only 
during waking hours in an individual who has reached a developmental age when 
urinary continence is ordinarily expected (5 years). The urinary incontinence may 
have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of norma l infantile 
incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bladder control. In 
most cases, the behaviour is involuntary but in some cases it appears intentional.
