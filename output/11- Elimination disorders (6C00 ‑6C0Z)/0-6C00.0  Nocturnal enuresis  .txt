6C00.0  Nocturnal enuresis  

  
Elimination disorders i nclude the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed (enuresis) and the 
repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places (encopresis). Elimination disorders should only be 
diagnosed after the individual has reached a developmental age when continence  is ordinarily 
expected (5 years for enuresis and 4 years for encopresis). The urinary or faecal incontinence may 
have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have 
arisen following a period of acquired  bladder or bowel control. An Elimination disorder should not be 
diagnosed if the behaviour is fully attributable to another health condition that causes incontinence, 
congenital or acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract or bowel, or excessive use of laxatives or 
diuretics.  
  6C00   Enuresis  
Enuresis is the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed, which may occur 
during the day or at night, in an individual who has reached a developmental age 
when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (5 year s). The urinary incontinence 
may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile 
incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bladder control. In 
most cases, the behaviour is involuntary but in some cases i t appears intentional. 
Enuresis should not be diagnosed if unintentional voiding of urine is due to a health 
condition that interferes with continence (e.g., diseases of the nervous system or 
musculoskeletal disorders) or by congenital or acquired abnormal ities of the urinary 
tract.
