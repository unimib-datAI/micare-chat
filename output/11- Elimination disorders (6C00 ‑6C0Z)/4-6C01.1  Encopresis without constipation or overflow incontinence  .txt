6C01.1  Encopresis without constipation or overflow incontinence  


Encopresis is the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places occurring 
repeatedly (e.g., at least once per month over a period of several months) in an 
individual who has  reached the developmental age when faecal continence is 
ordinarily expected (4 years). The faecal incontinence may have been present from 
birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have 
arisen following a period of acquir ed bowel control. Encopresis with constipation 
and overflow incontinence is the most common form of faecal soiling, and involves 
retention and impaction of faeces. Stools are typically — but not always — poorly 
formed (loose or liquid) and leakage may rang e from occasional to continuous. 
There is often a history of toilet avoidance leading to constipation.
