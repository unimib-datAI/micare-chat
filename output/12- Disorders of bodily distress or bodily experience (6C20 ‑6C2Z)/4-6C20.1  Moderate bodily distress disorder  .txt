6C20.1  Moderate bodily distress disorder  


All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is 
excessive attention to distressing symptoms and their consequences, which may 
result in frequent medical visits, but the person is not preoccupied with the 
symptoms (e.g., the individual spends less than an hour per day focusing on them). 
Although the individual expresses distress about the symptoms and they may have 
some impact on his or her life (e.g., strain in relationships, less effective academic 
or occupational functionin g, abandonment of specific leisure activities), there is no 
substantial impairment in the personâ€™s personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
