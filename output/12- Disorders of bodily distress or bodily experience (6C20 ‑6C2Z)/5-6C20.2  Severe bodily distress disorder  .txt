6C20.2  Severe bodily distress disorder  


All definitional requ irements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is 
persistent preoccupation with the distressing symptoms and their consequences 
(e.g., the individual spends more than an hour a day thinking about them), typically 
associated with frequent medical v isits. The person devotes much of his or her 
energy to focusing on the symptoms and their consequences. The symptoms and 
associated distress and preoccupation cause moderate impairment in personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational, or other import ant areas of functioning 
(e.g., relationship conflict, performance problems at work, abandonment of a range 
of social and leisure activities).
