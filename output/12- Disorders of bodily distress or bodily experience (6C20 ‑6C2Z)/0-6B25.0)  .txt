Bodily distress disorder is characterised by the presence of bodily symptoms that 
are distressing to the individual and excessive attention directed toward the 
symptoms, which may be manifest by repeated contact with health care providers. If 
another health condition is causing or contributing to the symptoms, the degree of 
attention is clearly excessive in relation to its nature and progression. Excessive 
attention is not alleviated by appropriat e clinical examination and investigations and 
appropriate reassurance. Bodily symptoms are persistent, being present on most 
days for at least several months. Typically, bodily distress disorder involves multiple 
bodily symptoms that may vary over time. Oc casionally there is a single symptom —
usually pain or fatigue —that is associated with the other features of the disorder. 
The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation have at least some 
impact on the individual’s functioning (e.g. strain in relati onships, less effective 
academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities).
