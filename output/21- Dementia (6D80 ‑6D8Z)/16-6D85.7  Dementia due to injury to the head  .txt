6D85.7  Dementia due to injury to the head  


Dem entia due to normal pressure hydrocephalus results from excess accumulation 
of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain as a result of idiopathic, non -obstructive causes 
but can also be secondary to haemorrhage, infection or inflammation. Progression 
is gradual bu t intervention (e.g., shunt) may result in improvement of symptoms, 
especially if administered earlier in the course of the condition. Typically, cognitive 
impairments include reduced processing speed and deficits in executive functioning 
and attention. Th ese symptoms are also typically accompanied by gait 
abnormalities and urinary incontinence. Brain imaging to reveal ventricular volume 
and characterize brain displacement is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
