6E61.3  Secondary  psychotic syndrome, with unspecified symptoms  


A syndrome characterised by the presence of both prominent hallucinations and 
prominent delusions that is judged to  be a direct pathophysiological consequence of 
a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on 
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The 
symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural 
disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical 
condition (e.g., an acute stress reaction in response to a life -threatening diagnosis). 
This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis f or the presumed 
underlying disorder or disease when the psychotic symptoms are sufficiently severe 
to warrant specific clinical attention.  
Coding Note:  Code also the causing condition  
Exclusions:  Delirium (6D70)
