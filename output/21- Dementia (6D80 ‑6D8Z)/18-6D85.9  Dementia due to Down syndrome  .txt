6D85.9  Dementia due to Down syndrome  


Dementia due to pellagra is caused by persistent lack of vitamin B3 (niacin) or 
tryptophan either in the diet or due to poor absorption in the gastrointesti nal tract 
due to disease (e.g., Crohn disease) or due to the effects of some medications 
(e.g., isoniazid). Core signs of pellagra include dermatological changes (sensitivity 
to sunlight, lesions, alopecia, and oedema) and diarrhoea. With prolonged 
nutriti onal deficiency cognitive symptoms that include aggressivity, motor 
disturbances (ataxia and restlessness), confusion, and weakness are observed. 
Treatment with nutritional supplementation (e.g., niacin) typically results in reversal 
of symptoms.
