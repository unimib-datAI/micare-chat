6D85.4  Dementia due to multiple sclerosis  


Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus develops during the course of 
confirmed HIV disease, in the absence of a concurrent illness or condition other 
than HIV infection that could explain the clinical features. Although a variety of 
patterns of cognit ive deficit are possible depending on where the HIV pathogenic 
processes have occurred, typically deficits follow a subcortical pattern with 
impairments in executive function, processing speed, attention, and learning new 
information. The course of Dementi a due to human immunodeficiency virus varies 
including resolution of symptoms, gradual decline in functioning, improvement, or 
fluctuation in symptoms. Rapid decline in cognitive functioning is rare with the 
advent of antiretroviral medications.  
Coding Not e: This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aeti ologies, code all that apply.
