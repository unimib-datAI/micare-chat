6E61.1  Secondary psychotic syndrome, with delusions  


A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent hallucinations that is 
judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not 
classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the 
history, physical exam ination, or laboratory findings. Delusions are not a prominent 
aspect of the clinical presentation. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium 
or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically 
mediated response to a severe me dical condition (e.g., an acute stress reaction in 
response to a life -threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition 
to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the 
psychotic symptoms are sufficiently severe to w arrant specific clinical attention.
