6D85.3  Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus  


Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins caused by toxic 
exposure to specific heavy metals such as aluminium from dialysis water, lead, 
mercury or manganese. The characteristic cognitive impairments in Dementia due 
to exposure to heavy met als and other toxins depend on the specific heavy metal or 
toxin that the individual has been exposed to but can affect any cognitive domain. 
Onset of symptoms is related to exposure and progression can be rapid especially 
with acute exposure. In many case s, symptoms are reversible when exposure is 
identified and ceases. Investigations such as brain imaging or neurophysiological 
testing may be abnormal. Lead poisoning is associated with abnormalities on brain 
imaging including widespread calcification and i ncreased signal on MRI T2 -
weighted images of periventricular white matter, basal ganglia hypothalamus and 
pons. Dementia due to aluminium toxicity may demonstrate characteristic 
paroxysmal high -voltage delta EEG changes. Examination may make evident other 
features such as peripheral neuropathy in the case of lead, arsenic, or mercury.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
