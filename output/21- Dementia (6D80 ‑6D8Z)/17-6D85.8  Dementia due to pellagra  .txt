6D85.8  Dementia due to pellagra  


Dementia due to injury to the head is caused by damage inflicted on the tissues of 
the brain as the direct or indirect result of an external force. Trauma to the brain is 
known to have resulted in loss of consciou sness, amnesia, disorientation and 
confusion, or neurological signs. The symptoms characteristic of Dementia due to 
injury to the head must arise immediately following the trauma or after the individual 
gains consciousness and must persist beyond the acute  post-injury period. 
Cognitive deficits vary depending on the specific brain areas affected and the 
severity of the injury but can include impairments in attention, memory, executive 
functioning, personality, processing speed, social cognition, and languag e abilities.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
