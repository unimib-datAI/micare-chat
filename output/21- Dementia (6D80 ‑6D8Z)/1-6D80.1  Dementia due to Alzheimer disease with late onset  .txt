6D80.1  Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with late onset  


Dementia due to Alzheimer disease in which symptoms emerge before the age of 
65 years. It is relatively rare, representing less than 5% of all cases, and may be 
genetically determined (autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease). Clinical 
presentation may be sim ilar to cases with later onset, but progression of cognitive 
deficits may be more rapid.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identi fy the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
