6E62.3  Secondary mood syndrome, with un specified symptoms  


A syndrome characterised by th e presence of both manic and depressive 
symptoms, either occurring together or alternating from day to day or over the 
course of a day that is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a 
health condition not classified under mental and behavi oural disorders based on 
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. Manic 
symptoms may include elevated, euphoric, irritable, or expansive mood states, rapid 
changes among different mood states (i.e., mood lability), or increa sed energy or 
activity. Depressive symptoms may include persistently depressed mood, loss of 
interest in previously enjoyable activities, or signs such as tearful or downtrodden 
appearance. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another menta l 
and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a 
severe medical condition (e.g., depressive symptoms in response to a life -
threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for 
the presumed un derlying disorder or disease when the mood symptoms are 
sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.
