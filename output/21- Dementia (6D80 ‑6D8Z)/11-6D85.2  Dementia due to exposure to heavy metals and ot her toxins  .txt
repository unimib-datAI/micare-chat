6D85.2  Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and ot her toxins  


Dementia due to Huntington disease occurs as part of a widespread degeneration 
of the brain due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which is 
transmitted through autosomal dominance. Onset of symptoms is insidious typically 
in the third and fourth decade of life with gradual and slow progression. Initial 
symptoms typically include impairments in executive functions with relative s paring 
of memory, prior to the onset of motor deficits (bradykinesia and chorea) 
characteristic of Huntington disease.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional code s when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.  
Inclusions:  Dementia in Huntington chorea
