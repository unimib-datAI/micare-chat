  6E62   Secondary mood syndrome  
A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent mood symptoms (i.e., 
depression, elevated mood, irritability) judged to be a  direct pathophysiological 
consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural 
disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory 
findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by anoth er mental and 
behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe 
medical condition (e.g., depressive symptoms in response to a life -threatening 
diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the 
presumed underlying disorder or disease when the mood symptoms are sufficiently 
severe to warrant specific clinical attention.
