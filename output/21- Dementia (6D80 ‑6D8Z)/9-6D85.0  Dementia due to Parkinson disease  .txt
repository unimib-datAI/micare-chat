6D85.0  Dementia due to Parkinson disease  


Dementia due to use of volatile inhalants is characterised by the development of 
persistent cognitive impairments (e.g., memory problems, language impairment, 
and an inability to perform complex motor tasks) that meet the definitional 
requirements of Dementia that are judged to be a direct consequence of inhalant 
use or exposure and that persist beyond the usual duration of action or withdrawal 
syndrome associated with the substance. The amount and duration of inhalant use 
or exposure must be sufficient to be capable of producing the cognitive impairment. 
The cognitive im pairment is not better accounted for by a disorder that is not 
induced by volatile inhalants such as a dementia due to another medical condition.
