6D86.0  Psychotic symptoms in dementia  


Dementia due to Down syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder related to the 
impact of abnormal increased production and accumulation of amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) leading to fo rmation of beta -amyloid plaques and tau tangles. APP 
gene expression is increased due to its location on chromosome 21, which is 
abnormally triplicated in Down syndrome. Cognitive deficits and neuropathological 
features are similar to those observed in Alz heimer disease. Onset is typically after 
the fourth decade of life with a gradual decline in functioning, and may impact 50% 
or more of individuals with Down syndrome.
