 Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders or diseases 
classified elsewhere (6E60 â€‘6E6Z)  
This grouping includes sy ndromes characterised by the presence of prominent psychological or 
behavioural symptoms judged to be direct pathophysiological consequences of a medical condition 
not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, p hysical 
examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another 
mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe 
medical condition (e.g., adjustment disorder or anxiety s ymptoms in response to being diagnosed with 
a life -threatening illness). These categories should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the 
presumed underlying disorder or disease when the psychological and behavioural symptoms are 
sufficiently severe to  warrant specific clinical attention.
