6D85.5  Dementia due to prion disease  


Dementia due to multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease due to the 
cerebral effects of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease. Onset of symptoms 
is insidious and not secondary to the functional impairment attributable to the 
primary disease (i.e., multiple sclerosis). Cognitive impairments vary according to 
the location of demyelination but typically include deficits in processing speed, 
memory, attention, and aspects of executive functioning.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used i n primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
