6D85.6  Dementia due to normal pressure hydrocephalus  


Dementia due to prion disease is a primary neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
group of spongiform encephalopathies resulting from abnormal prion protein 
accumulation in the brain. These can be sporadic, genetic (caused by mu tations in 
the prion -protein gene), or transmissible (acquired from an infected individual). 
Onset is insidious and there is a rapid progression of symptoms and impairment 
characterised by cognitive deficits, ataxia, and motor symptoms (myoclonus, 
chorea, or dystonia). Diagnosis is typically made on the basis of brain imaging 
studies, presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid, EEG, or genetic testing.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.
