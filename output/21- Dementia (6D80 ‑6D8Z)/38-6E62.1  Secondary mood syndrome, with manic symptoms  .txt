A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent depressive symptoms such 
as persistently depressed mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, or 
signs such as tearful and downtrodden a ppearance that is judged to be a direct 
pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental 
and behavioural disorders based on evidence from the history, physical 
examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accoun ted for by 
delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a 
psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., depressive 
symptoms in response to a life -threatening diagnosis). This category should be 
used in additi on to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease 
when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical 
attention.
