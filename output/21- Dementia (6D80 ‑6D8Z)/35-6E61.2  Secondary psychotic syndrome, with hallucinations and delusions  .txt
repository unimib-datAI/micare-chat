6E61.2  Secondary psychotic syndrome, with hallucinations and delusions  


A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent delusions tha t is judged to 
be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified 
under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, 
physical examination, or laboratory findings. Hallucinations are not a prominent 
aspe ct of the clinical presentation. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium 
or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically 
mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., an acute stress reaction in 
response to a li fe-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition 
to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the 
psychotic symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.
