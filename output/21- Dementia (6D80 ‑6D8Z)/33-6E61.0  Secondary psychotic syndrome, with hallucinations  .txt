development that do not fulfill the diagnostic requirements of any of the specific 
developmental speech or language disorders that is judged to be a direct 
pathophysiological consequence of a h ealth condition not classified under mental 
and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical 
examination, or laboratory findings. Possible etiologies include a disease of the

A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent hallucinations or delusions 
judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not 
classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the 
history, physical examination, or laboratory find ings. The symptoms are not 
accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are 
not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., an 
acute stress reaction in response to a life -threatening diagnosis). This category

disease when the psychotic symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific 
clinical attention.
