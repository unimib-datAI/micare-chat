6D84.2  Dementia due to use of volatile inhalants  


Dementia due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics is characterised by the 
development of persistent cognitive impairments (e.g., memory problems, language 
impairment, and an inability to perform complex motor tasks) that meet the 
definitional requ irements of Dementia that are judged to be a direct consequence of 
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use and that persist beyond the usual duration of 
action or withdrawal syndrome associated with the substance. The amount and 
duration of sedative, hypnoti c, or anxiolytic use must be sufficient to produce the 
cognitive impairment. The cognitive impairment is not better accounted for by a 
disorder that is not induced by sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics such as a 
dementia due to another medical condition.  
Coding Note:  This category should never be used in primary tabulation. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.  
When dementia is due to multiple aetiologies, code all that apply.  
Inclusions:  Late-onset psychoactive substance -induced psychotic disorder
