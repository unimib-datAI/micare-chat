1§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: The authors would like to thank Arshya Vahabzadeh, M.D., for his contributions to an earlier edition of this case.Robyn Thom, M.D. Eugene Beresin, M.D.Christopher McDougle, M.D.Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.Brandon's sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class.The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he'd had an outburst at school.When interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: "dumbo!!!!" "mr stutter"; "LoSeR"; "freak!"; "EVERYBODYHATES YOU." While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper "bad words" to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. "And I hate loud noises." He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.Developmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains.According to his mother, he had always been "very shy" and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because "he takes things so literally." Brandon's mother had long seen this behavior as "a little odd" but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon's father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were "sticklers for routine" who "lacked a sense of humor." Brandon's mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear "normal" when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.On examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below- average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.§Based on ICD-11 criteria and context provided, Brandon's condition aligns with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (6B21.1), characterized by preoccupation with perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance which are not observable to others, poor insight into the irrationality of these beliefs, and significant distress impacting social functioning including avoidance behaviors when discussing his interest in vehicles (trucks/cars). His wandering preoccupation appears separate from a dementia-related disinhibition or aggression.
2§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Stewart Adelson, M.D. Rosemary Tannock, Ph.D.Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital's outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos's "ADHD" might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.Carlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantlycombined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he "could play for hours." Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.During the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming.His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos's pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out "on the street." Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son "with concentration and reading." The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.The psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos's academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos's acculturation experiences, the family's past feelings about the clinic's recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.The psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of "nervousness" identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.Since starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to "have fun" like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went "up and down" over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.Carlos said that he'd had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments.Without this support at college, he said he felt "lonely, stupid, a failure-unable to cope."Although advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university's student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.Carlos's family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had "dyslexia" and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.On examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans,a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said "literalchure" instead of "literature" and "intimate" when he clearly meant "intimidate"). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that "in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I'm the only Dominican." He also quietly said that he thought he might "like guys rather than girls." He revealed two recent episodes of panic "like when I was a kid" that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.After these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos's reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.§Based on the provided context and description, Carlos does not appear to meet the criteria for Conduct -dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions as outlined under code 6C91.00 in DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). While he displays some behavioral challenges such as lacking re straint, poor risk assessment might be inferred from his impulsivity during social situations which may cause him to act without considering the consequences; however this does not necessarily translate into callousness or a consistent disregard for others' feelings.Instead, Carlos exhibits signs of developmental speech and language difficulties as he struggles with reading fluency, comprehension, spelling, and written expression (6A01). These issues are separate from the typical social conventions mentioned in dementia cases like disinhibition or wandering. His accent suggests that English is not his first language which can contribute to communication difficulties but again it's a cultural/ethnic variance rather than an intellectual developmental issue, as confirmed by psychoeducational testing results (6A01).Furthermore, Carlos displays feelings of being overwhelmed in social situations and his anxiety around sexual orientation. These are not typically symptoms associated with Conduct -dissocial disorder but rather may be indicative of difficulties related to acculturation or potential concerns about one's identity (which could potentially trigger some sort of internal conflict, considering the DSM-5 criteria for conduct issues does not directly apply here).Consequently, it seems that Carlos is facing challenges primarily associated with language development and adjustment into college life as an ethnic minority which are separate from symptoms characterizing Conduct -dissocial disorder. It may be beneficial to continue supporting him in his academic struggles while simultaneously addressing his social concerns related to cultural transition, anxiety about sexual orientation or potential bullying due to being the only Dominican student at college (this is not mentioned directly but could explain feelings of overwhelm).In conclusion: Carlos's clinical picture does not align with Conduct -dissocial disorder as his issues are more closely associated with language development difficulties and acculturation struggles. These aspects should be the focus areas in treatment planning rather than considering a conduct-related diagnosis based on limited information provided about social conventions, risk assessment or lack of empathy (6C91.00).
3§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Arden D. Dingle, M.D.Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable.She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age- appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne's teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help.Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant.She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.At home, Daphne's parents' close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second- degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appearedanxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.§Based on ICD-11 criteria, Daphne may be diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Emotional Self-Regulation (6B21.1). Her struggles in school due to poor visuospatial skills and her history suggest a reaction that exceeds what would be expected from ordinary life stressors, impacting social interactions significantly as evidenced by withdrawal when rules are not followed or peer preferences emerge. The acute emotional distress related to body image concerns (as implied in the negative self-perception about intelligence and appearance) align with this diagnosis rather than a primary psychotic disorder, which is now remitted according to ICD-10 but does not fit as well into her current context. Disinhibition typically associated with dementia's D68 code seems less relevant here due to the absence of significant cognitive impairments indicative of that condition in this case report.(Note: The provided codes and disorders do reference conditions related to ICD systems, but for an accurate diagnosis within current clinical guidelines (such as DSM-5), a healthcare professional must be consulted.)
4§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Robert Haskell, M.D. John T. Walkup, M.D.Ethan, a 9-year-old boy, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed that his attention was flagging. At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan's parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him.At home, Ethan's mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: "He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him." She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a "happy family." She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He hadbecome "clingy," often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers.Ethan's mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him.His mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become "superstitious." Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan's more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan's father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip ("just the boys") while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City.Ethan's mother recalled her son as an "easy child, but sensitive." He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time.He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse's office complaining of stomachaches.On examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises. Ethan said that he sometimes worried about "bad things" happening to his parents. His concerns were vague, however, and he seemed to fear only that burglars might break into their house.§The symptoms described in Ethan's case, including anxiety-driven behaviors such as clinginess and body dysmorphia with poor insight (e.g., touching doorjambs simultaneously), wandering thoughts about potential harm to his parents, disinhibition, agitation or mild forms of aggression may suggest a possible diagnosis within the realm of dementia spectrum conditions according to ICD-11. However, as these symptoms are also observed in children with developmental and anxiety concerns, it is essential for healthcare providers to consider pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders alongside cognitive assessments specific to early onset mental states.
5§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Carol A. Tamminga, M.D.Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared tobe an "emotionally disturbed person," a psychiatry consultation was requested.According to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen's who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, "Sorry, sorry." She did not respond to other questions.More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen's first bus ride without a staff member.According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of "childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia." She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to "have my own room in my own house with my own friends." The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated.The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.§Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder, First Episode - Based on the ICD-11 criteria (6A23.02), Ms. Allen's case can be diagnosed as Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder with a first episode in full remission. This is due to her history of paranoid schizop0hrenia, current lack of significant symptoms despite previous episodes characterized by auditory hallucinations (critical voice), implying that she has experienced some form of psychosis but currently shows signs of recovery or improvement ("no significant symptoms remain"). The context does not provide enough evidence to diagnose wandering dementia, delusional disorder in full remission without further information on cognitive disturbances beyond the mentioned hallucinations. Hence, Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder with a first episode is concluded as her current condition following improvement possibly due to medication like clozapine treatment for schizophrenia (6D86.6).
6§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: William S. Stone, Ph.D.Ming T. Tsuang, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc.Gregory Baker was a 20-year-old African American man who was brought to the emergency room (ER) by the campus police of the university from which he had been suspended several months earlier. The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, "I am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman." When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security.Although Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were "conducting a symphony." He denied having anyintention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university's student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.During the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker's sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker's sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.His family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.On examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital's food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling "bad" but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.Mr. Baker's grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker's mother was reportedly "crazy." She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother.Ultimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, "I don't mind staying here. Anne will probably be there, so I can spend my time with her."§Based on the ICD-11 criteria, Mr. Baker's diagnosis could be Acute and transient psychotic disorder with possible elements of Delusional Disorder due to his grandiose delusions about being Batman and a romantic involvement that does not exist in reality (focused on Anne). The key factors for this classification are the recent, short-lived nature of these symptoms along with their full remission. However, further assessment is needed due to his wandering behavior which may indicate Dementia Wandering under code 6D86.6 as well given that there could be a cognitive component involved (less oriented in time).(Note: The provided ICD-10 context does not directly apply, and the modern equivalent would likely align with codes from the International Classification of Diseases Eleventh Revision (ICD-11), which was updated after my knowledge cutoff date.)
7§based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Lianne K. Morris Smith, M.D. Dolores Malaspina, M.D., M.P.H.Hakim Coleman was a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran turned community college student who presented to the emergency room (ER) with his girlfriend and sister. Onexamination, he was a tall, slim, and well-groomed young man with glasses. He spoke softly, with an increased latency of speech. His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms.Mr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister's suggestion. He said he could use a "general checkup" because of several days of "migraines" and "hallucinations of a spiritual nature" that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved "sharp, shooting" sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a "ringing" sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices.Mr. Coleman described his vices as being "alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls." He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim's military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being "riddled with guilt" about "all the things I've done." Three months earlier, he began "hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty" most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.Mr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he "quit" 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank "a beer or two" every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.Regarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman's score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans. He denied that his military experience was unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. Regarding other stressors, he felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near-daily church activities. He had been a straight-A student at the start of the school year but was now receiving Bs and Cs.The patient's girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr. Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode. His sister believed that Mr. Coleman had been "brainwashed" by the church. His girlfriend, however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were worried about him.A physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan was normal.§The diagnosis for Hakim Coleman, based on the ICD-11 and provided context, could be Delusional Disorder (6A24.2) that is currently in full remission. The patient's history of guilt about past behaviors coupled with auditory hallucinations suggestive of delusion aligns with this classification. His current lack of significant symptoms and the potential for treatment response further support this diagnosis, as indicated by his girlfriend’s account that no other church members experienced similar experiences which could imply an external influence or trigger rather than a chronic disorder. However, there's also consideration given to Wandering in Dementia (6A23.12) and Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder due to his recent life changes; but these are less likely as the symptoms have ameliorated into remission for an extended period suggesting a resolved episode rather than ongoing decline indicative of dementia or persistent acute psychosis without significant improvement.
