6A23.02  Acute and transient psychotic disorder, first episode, in full remission  


All definitional requirements for Acute and transient psychotic disorder, first episode 
in terms of symptoms and duration were previously met. Symptoms have 
ameliorated such that the diagnostic requirements for the disorder have not been  
met for at least one month, but some clinically significant symptoms remain, which 
may or may not be associated with functional impairment. The partial remission may 
have occurred in response to medication or other treatment.
