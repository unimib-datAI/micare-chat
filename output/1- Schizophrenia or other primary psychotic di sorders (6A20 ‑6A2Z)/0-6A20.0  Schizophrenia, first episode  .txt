6A20.0  Schizophrenia, first episode  

  
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders are characterised by significant impairments in 
reality testing and alterations in behaviour manifest in positive symptoms such as persistent 
delusions, persistent hallucinations, diso rganised thinking (typically manifest as disorganised speech), 
grossly disorganised behaviour, and experiences of passivity and control, negative symptoms such as 
blunted or flat affect and avolition, and psychomotor disturbances. The symptoms occur with s ufficient 
frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural norms. These symptoms do 
not arise as a feature of another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., a mood disorder, delirium, or 
a disorder due to substance use). The categor ies in this grouping should not be used to classify the 
expression of ideas, beliefs, or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned.

  6A20   Schizophrenia  
Schizophre nia is characterised by disturbances in multiple mental modalities, 
including thinking (e.g., delusions, disorganisation in the form of thought), 
perception (e.g., hallucinations), self -experience (e.g., the experience that one's 
feelings, impulses, though ts, or behaviour are under the control of an external 
force), cognition (e.g., impaired attention, verbal memory, and social cognition), 
volition (e.g., loss of motivation), affect (e.g., blunted emotional expression), and 
behaviour (e.g., behaviour that a ppears bizarre or purposeless, unpredictable or 
inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with the organisation of behaviour). 
Psychomotor disturbances, including catatonia, may be present. Persistent 
delusions, persistent hallucinations, thought di sorder, and experiences of influence, 
passivity, or control are considered core symptoms. Symptoms must have persisted 
for at least one month in order for a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be assigned. The 
symptoms are not a manifestation of another health c ondition (e.g., a brain tumour) 
and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g., alcohol withdrawal).
