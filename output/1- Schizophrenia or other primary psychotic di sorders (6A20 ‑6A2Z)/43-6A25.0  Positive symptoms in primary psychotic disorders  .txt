These categories may be used to characterize the current clinical presentation in 
individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, 
and should not be used in individuals without such a diagnosis. Multiple categories 
may be app lied. Symptoms attributable to the direct pathophysiological 
consequences of a health condition or injury not classified under Mental, 
behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., a brain tumour or traumatic 
brain injury), or to the direct effects of  a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system, including withdrawal effects, should not be considered as 
examples of the respective types of symptoms.  
Coding Note:  These categories should never be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of these symptoms in primary psychotic disorders.
