  6A24   Delusional disorder  
Delusional disorder is characterised by the development of a delusion or set of 
related delusions, typically persisting for at least 3 months and often much longer, in 
the absenc e of a Depressive, Manic, or Mixed mood episode. The delusions are 
variable in content across individuals, but typically stable within individuals, although 
they may evolve over time. Other characteristic symptoms of Schizophrenia (i.e. 
clear and persisten t hallucinations, negative symptoms, disorganised thinking, or 
experiences of influence, passivity, or control) are not present, although various 
forms of perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations, illusions, misidentifications of 
persons) thematically related to the delusion are still consistent with the diagnosis. 
Apart from actions and attitudes directly related to the delusion or delusional 
system, affect, speech, and behavior are typically unaffected. The symptoms are 
not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) and are not 
due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. 
corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol withdrawal).
