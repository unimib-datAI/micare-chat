6A24.2  Delusional disorder, in full remission  


All definitional requirements for Delusional disorder in terms of symptoms and 
duration were previously met. Symptoms have ameliorated such that the diagnostic 
requirements for the disorder have not been met for at least one month, but some 
clinically sign ificant symptoms remain, which may or may not be associated with 
functional impairment. The partial remission may have occurred in response to 
medication or other treatment.
