  6A21   Schizoaffective disorder  
Schizoaffective disorder is an episodic disorder in which the diagnostic 
requirements of schizophrenia and a manic, mixed, or moderate or severe 
depressive episode are met within the same episode of illness, either 
simultaneously or within a few days of each other. Prominent symptoms of 
schizophrenia (e.g. delusions, hallucination s, disorganisation in the form of thought, 
experiences of influence, passivity and control) are accompanied by typical 
symptoms of a moderate or severe depressive episode (e.g. depressed mood, loss 
of interest, reduced energy), a manic episode (e.g. an ext reme mood state 
characterised by euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness; increased activity or a 
subjective experience of increased energy) or a mixed episode. Psychomotor 
disturbances, including catatonia, may be present. Symptoms must have persisted 
for at least one month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical 
condition (e.g. a brain tumor) and are not due to the effect of a substance or 
medication on the central nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including 
withdrawal (e.g. alcohol  withdrawal).
