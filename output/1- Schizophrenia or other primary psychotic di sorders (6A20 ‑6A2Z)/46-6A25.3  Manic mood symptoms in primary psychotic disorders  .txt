6A25.3  Manic mood symptoms in primary psychotic disorders  


Depressive mood symptoms in primary psychotic disorders refer to depressed 
mood as reported by the  individual (feeling down, sad) or manifested as a sign (e.g. 
tearful, defeated appearance). If only non -mood symptoms of a depressive episode 
are present (e.g., anhedonia, psychomotor slowing), this descriptor should not be 
used. This descriptor may be us ed whether or not depressive symptoms meet the 
diagnostic requirements of a separately diagnosed Depressive disorder. The rating 
should be made based on the severity of depressive mood symptoms during the 
past week.  
Coding Note:  These categories should nev er be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of these symptoms in primary psychotic disorders.
