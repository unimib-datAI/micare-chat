6A25.2  Depressive mood symptoms in primary psychotic disorders  


Negative symptoms in primary psychotic disorders include constricted, blunted, or 
flat affect, alogia or paucity of speech, avolition (general lack of drive, or lack of 
motivation to pursue meanin gful goals), asociality (reduced or absent engagement 
with others and interest in social interaction) and anhedonia (inability to experience 
pleasure from normally pleasurable activities). To be considered negative psychotic 
symptoms, relevant symptoms sho uld not be entirely attributable to antipsychotic 
drug treatment, a depressive disorder, or an under -stimulating environment, and 
should not be a direct consequence of a positive symptom (e.g., persecutory 
delusions causing a person to become socially isol ated due to fear of harm). The 
rating should be made based on the severity of negative symptoms during the past 
week.  
Coding Note:  These categories should never be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify the 
presence of these symptoms in primary psychotic disorders.
