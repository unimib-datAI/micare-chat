6A25.4  Psychomotor symptoms in primary psychotic disorders  


Manic  mood symptoms in primary psychotic disorders refer to elevated, euphoric, 
irritable, or expansive mood states, including rapid changes among different mood 
states (i.e., mood lability). It also includes increased subjective experience of 
energy, which may  be accompanied by increased goal -directed activity. The 
severity of associated non -mood symptoms of a Manic or Hypomanic Episode (e.g., 
decreased need for sleep, distractibility) should not be considered in making a 
rating. Increased non -goal-directed psy chomotor activity should be considered as 
part of the rating of the 'psychomotor symptoms in primary psychotic disorders' 
rather than here. This descriptor may be used whether or not the manic symptoms 
meet the diagnostic requirements of a separately diagn osed bipolar disorder. The 
rating should be made based on the severity of manic mood symptoms during the 
past week.  
Coding Note:  These categories should never be used in primary coding. The codes are provided 
for use as supplementary or additional codes wh en it is desired to identify the 
presence of these symptoms in primary psychotic disorders.
