6A20.22  Schizophrenia, continuous, in full remission  


All definitional requirements for Schizophrenia, continuous in terms of symptoms 
and duration were previously met. Symptoms have ameliorated such that the 
diagnostic requirements for the disorder have not been met for at least one month, 
but some clinically significant symptoms remain, which may or may not be 
associated with functional imp airment. The partial remission may have occurred in 
response to medication or other treatment.
