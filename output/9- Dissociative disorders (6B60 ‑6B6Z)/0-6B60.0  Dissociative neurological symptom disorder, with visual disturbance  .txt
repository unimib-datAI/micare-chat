Dissociative disorders are characterised by involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal

memories, control over bodily movements, or behaviour. Disruption or discontinuity may be complete, 
but is more commonly partial, and can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. The symptoms 
of dissociative disorders are not due to the direct ef fects of a medication or substance, including 
withdrawal effects, are not better explained by another Mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental 
disorder, a Sleep -wake disorder, a Disease of the nervous system or other health condition, and are 
not part of  an accepted cultural, religious, or spiritual practice. Dissociative symptoms in dissociative 
disorders are sufficiently severe to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of function ing.
