Dissociative amnesia is characterised by an inability to recall important 
autobiographical memories, typically of recent traumatic or stressful events, that is 
inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. The amnesia does not occur exclusively during 
another dis sociative disorder and is not better explained by another mental, 
behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder. The amnesia is not due to the direct 
effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including 
withdrawal effects, and is not due to a disease of the nervous system or to head 
trauma. The amnesia results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
