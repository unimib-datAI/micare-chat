6D72.1  Amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances including medications  


All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory symptoms 
are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition  
not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, based 
on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The 
symptoms are not better explained by Delirium, Dementia, another mental disorder 
(e.g., Schizo phrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder) or the 
effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects. The symptoms 
are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention. The identified 
etiological medical c ondition should be classified separately.
