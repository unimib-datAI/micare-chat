6D72.1 0 Amnestic disorder due to use of alcohol  


All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory symptoms 
are judged to be the direct consequence of psychoactive substance use. The 
intensity a nd duration of substance use must be known to be capable of producing 
memory impairment. The memory impairment may develop during or soon after 
substance intoxication or withdrawal, but its intensity and duration are substantially 
in excess of those normal ly associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not 
better accounted for by another disorder or medical condition, as might be the case 
if the amnestic symptoms preceded the onset of substance use.  
Coding Note:  Code also the causing condition
