6D72.13  Amnestic disorder due to use of volatile inhalants  


medications  
All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory symptoms 
are judged to be the direct consequence of use of a specified psychoactive 
substance other than alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; or volatile 
inhalants. The intens ity and duration of use of the specified psychoactive substance 
must be known to be capable of producing memory impairment. The memory 
impairment may develop during or soon after specified psychoactive substance 
intoxication or withdrawal, but its intensit y and duration are substantially in excess 
of those normally associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not better 
accounted for by another disorder or medical condition, as might be the case if the 
amnestic symptoms preceded the onset of the speci fied psychoactive substance.
