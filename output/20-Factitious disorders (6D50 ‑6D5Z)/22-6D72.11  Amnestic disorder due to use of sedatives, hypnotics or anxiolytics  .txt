6D72.11  Amnestic disorder due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics  


All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory symptoms 
are judged to be the direct consequence of alcohol use. The intensity and duration 
of alcohol use must be known to be capable of prod ucing memory impairment. The 
memory impairment may develop during or soon after alcohol intoxication or 
withdrawal, but its intensity and duration are substantially in excess of those 
normally associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not better a ccounted 
for by another disorder or medical condition, as might be the case if the amnestic 
symptoms preceded the onset of the alcohol use.  
Coding Note:  This category should not be used to describe cognitive changes due to thiamine 
deficiency associated wi th chronic alcohol use.
