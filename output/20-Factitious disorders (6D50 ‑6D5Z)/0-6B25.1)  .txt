Factitious disorders are characterised by intentionally feigning, falsifying, inducing, or aggravating 
medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury in oneself or in another per son, 
most commonly a child dependent, associated with identified deception. A pre -existing disorder or 
disease may be present, but the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or 
induces additional symptoms. Individuals with facti tious disorder seek treatment or otherwise present 
themselves or another person as ill, injured, or impaired based on the feigned, falsified, or self -
induced signs, symptoms, or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious 
external rewards or incentives (e.g., obtaining disability payments or evading criminal prosecution). 
This is in contrast to Malingering, in which obvious external rewards or incentives motivate the 
behaviour.
