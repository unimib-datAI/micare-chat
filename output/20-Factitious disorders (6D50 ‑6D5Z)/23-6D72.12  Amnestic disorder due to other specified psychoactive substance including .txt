6D72.12  Amnestic disorder due to other specified psychoactive substance including 


All definitional requirements for amnestic disorder are met. The memory sympt oms 
are judged to be the direct consequence of use of sedatives, hypnotics or 
anxiolytics. The intensity and duration of use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics 
must be known to be capable of producing memory impairment. The memory 
impairment may develo p during or soon after sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic 
intoxication or withdrawal, but its intensity and duration are substantially in excess 
of those normally associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not better 
accounted for by another disorder  or medical condition, as might be the case if the 
amnestic symptoms preceded the onset of use of sedatives, hypnotics or 
anxiolytics.  
Coding Note:  Code also the causing condition
