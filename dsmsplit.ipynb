      "based on the icd-11 make a diagnosis for this case: Anthony O. Ahmed, Ph.D.John Evans was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol.After an apparently normal childhood, Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years. At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.Around age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt- ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.Although he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.Mr. Evans's history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several- month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.\n"

       "\"Based on the information provided and using the ICD-11 classification system, a diagnosis for Itsuki Daishi could include:\\n\\n1. 6A20 Schizophrenia\\n\\nThis is the primary diagnosis, supported by:\\n- Positive symptoms:\\n  - Delusions: persecutory (being monitored, mind control devices), grandiose (belief he will become prime minister of Japan), referential (TV reporters commenting on him)\\n  - No clear hallucinations currently, though he had transient auditory experiences during cannabis use\\n- Negative symptoms:\\n  - Social withdrawal\\n- Duration: Symptoms have persisted for at least 3 months\\n- Functional decline: Irregular class attendance, declining academic performance\\n- Absence of mood disorder or substance use that better explains symptoms\\n\\n2. 6A20.0 Schizophrenia, first episode\\n\\nThis specifier is appropriate because this appears to be Mr. Daishi's first presentation with these symptoms, and there's no history of prior episodes or treatment.\\n\\n3. 6C41.0 Cannabis episode use (in remission)\\n\\nMr. Daishi reported using cannabis during his trip to Japan, which led to transient psychotic-like experiences. However, he denies current use.\\n\\n4. 6A23 Acute and transient psychotic disorder (differential diagnosis)\\n\\nWhile the duration of symptoms (3 months) suggests schizophrenia, the relatively acute onset and lack of prior history make it important to consider this diagnosis as well.\\n\\n5. 6A24 Delusional disorder (differential diagnosis)\\n\\nThe prominence of delusions with relatively preserved functioning in some areas (personal hygiene, coherent speech) makes this a consideration, but the presence of negative symptoms and functional decline favor a diagnosis of schizophrenia.\\n\\nAdditional factors to consider:\\n\\n- Cultural factors: As a Japanese student in the US, cultural adjustment stress may be playing a role in the manifestation of symptoms\\n- Academic stress\\n- Possible underlying personality traits (described as somewhat shy)\\n\\nA comprehensive clinical assessment would be necessary to confirm these diagnoses and rule out other possibilities. The treatment plan should address:\\n\\n1. Antipsychotic medication to address psychotic symptoms\\n2. Individual therapy, potentially including cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis\\n3. Psychoeducation for Mr. Daishi and his uncle about schizophrenia\\n4. Academic accommodations and support to help him continue his studies\\n5. Cultural competence in treatment, considering his background\\n6. Substance use assessment and education, particularly regarding cannabis\\n7. Regular monitoring of symptoms and medication side effects\\n8. Family involvement in treatment, possibly through video calls with his parents in Japan\\n\\nThe goal should be to stabilize Mr. Daishi's acute symptoms, improve his insight, and work towards restoring his previous level of academic and social functioning. Given the recent onset, relatively preserved functioning in some areas, and lack of family history, the prognosis could be favorable with appropriate treatment. However, ongoing management and support will be crucial.\""

    "    \"\"\"Based on the information provided in this case study and using the ICD-11 classification system, a potential diagnosis for Brandon could be:\\n\\n6A02 Autism spectrum disorder\\n\\nSpecifically, this diagnosis is supported by several key features described in the case:\\n\\n1. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction:\\n   - Difficulty making friends and mistrusting peers\\' intentions\\n   - Below-average eye contact\\n   - Struggles with jokes and typical adolescent banter\\n   - Taking things literally\\n   - General avoidance of socializing\\n\\n2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities:\\n   - Intense focus on trucks, cars, and trains since an early age\\n   - Bringing toy vehicles to school\\n   - Being a \"stickler for routine\"\\n\\n3. Symptoms present from early childhood:\\n   - Always been \"very shy\" and never had a best friend\\n   - Early focus on vehicles\\n\\n4. Symptoms causing significant impairment in social and academic functioning:\\n   - Declining school performance\\n   - Difficulties interacting with peers\\n   - Reluctance to attend school\\n\\nAdditional features that support this diagnosis include:\\n\\n- Sensory sensitivities (e.g., \"I hate loud noises\")\\n- Difficulty understanding social cues and interpreting others\\' intentions\\n- Attempts to mask autistic traits (\"tries to appear \\'normal\\'\")\\n- Family history (father with similar traits)\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that Brandon is also experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are common co-occurring conditions in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. These include:\\n\\n- Anxiety: stomachaches on school mornings, feeling nervous around peers\\n- Depression: saying he sometimes wished he had never been born, appearing sad\\n\\nAdditionally, Brandon\\'s speech difficulties (stumbling over words, pausing excessively, repeating words) might suggest a co-occurring speech disorder, possibly 6A01.1 Developmental speech fluency disorder (stuttering).\\n\\nWhile this diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder seems most fitting based on the ICD-11 criteria and the information provided, it\\'s crucial to emphasize that a comprehensive clinical assessment would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. The assessment should also consider Brandon\\'s strengths and specific support needs to develop an appropriate treatment plan.\"\"\",\n",

MB23.E Adjustment disorder\\n\\nThis could be considered due to:\\n- Difficulties adjusting to the college environment\\n- Symptoms of anxiety and depression related to this transition\\n\\n6. 6B04 Depressive episode\\n\\nConsider as a possible comorbidity due to:\\n- Feelings of hopelessness\\n- Poor concentration\\n- Insomnia\\n- Low energy\\n- Anhedonia (\"inability to have fun\")\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that Carlos is also dealing with several psychosocial factors that, while not diagnoses themselves, are crucial to consider in his overall assessment:\\n\\n- Acculturation stress (being the only Dominican in his college environment)\\n- Identity development issues (questioning sexual orientation)\\n- Academic pressure (being the first in his family to attend college)\\n\\nA comprehensive clinical assessment would be necessary to confirm these diagnoses and rule out other possibilities. The treatment plan should address not only the specific disorders but also Carlos\\'s psychosocial stressors and cultural context. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore supports and accommodations available through the university\\'s disability services to help Carlos manage his learning difficulties.\"\"\",\n",

The treatment plan should address not only the specific disorders but also Ethan\\'s academic performance and family dynamics. \\n\\nThe treatment approach should be multifaceted, potentially including cognitive-behavioral therapy for OCD and anxiety, habit reversal training for tics, and family therapy to address parental responses to Ethan\\'s symptoms.

The treatment plan should address not only the specific disorders but also Ms. Allen\\'s psychosocial needs, including:\\n\\n- Continued antipsychotic medication management\\n- Psychosocial rehabilitation\\n- Life skills training\\n- Supported employment and housing options\\n- Weight management and metabolic monitoring\\n- Legal advocacy\\n\\nThe goal should be to continue supporting Ms. Allen\\'s progress towards greater independence while managing her symptoms and addressing her developmental and social needs.'"
